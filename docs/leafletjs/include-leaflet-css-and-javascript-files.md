### Include Leaflet CSS and JavaScript Files

Source: https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start

This snippet shows how to include the Leaflet CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document. Ensure the CSS is in the head and the JavaScript is placed after the CSS.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
     integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY="
     crossorigin=""/>

<!-- Make sure you put this AFTER Leaflet's CSS -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js"
     integrity="sha256-20nQCchB9co0qIjJZRGuk2/Z9VM+kNiyxNV1lvTlZBo="
     crossorigin=""></script>
```
