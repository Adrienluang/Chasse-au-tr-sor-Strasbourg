### Build Leaflet from Source

Source: https://leafletjs.com/download

This command initiates the build process for Leaflet from its source code. It combines and compresses the source files, saving the output to the 'dist' folder. This requires Node.js and dependencies to be installed.

```bash
npm run build
```
