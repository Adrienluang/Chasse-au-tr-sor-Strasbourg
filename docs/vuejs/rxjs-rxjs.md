### RxJS {#rxjs}

[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is a library for working with asynchronous event streams. The [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) library provides the [`@vueuse/rxjs`](https://vueuse.org/rxjs/readme.html) add-on for connecting RxJS streams with Vue's reactivity system.

## Connection to Signals {#connection-to-signals}

Quite a few other frameworks have introduced reactivity primitives similar to refs from Vue's Composition API, under the term "signals":

- [Solid Signals](https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/signals)
- [Angular Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)
- [Preact Signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/)
- [Qwik Signals](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/components/state/#usesignal)

Fundamentally, signals are the same kind of reactivity primitive as Vue refs. It's a value container that provides dependency tracking on access, and side-effect triggering on mutation. This reactivity-primitive-based paradigm isn't a particularly new concept in the frontend world: it dates back to implementations like [Knockout observables](https://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observables.html) and [Meteor Tracker](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html) from more than a decade ago. Vue Options API and the React state management library [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) are also based on the same principles, but hide the primitives behind object properties.

Although not a necessary trait for something to qualify as signals, today the concept is often discussed alongside the rendering model where updates are performed through fine-grained subscriptions. Due to the use of Virtual DOM, Vue currently [relies on compilers to achieve similar optimizations](/guide/extras/rendering-mechanism#compiler-informed-virtual-dom). However, we are also exploring a new Solid-inspired compilation strategy, called [Vapor Mode](https://github.com/vuejs/core-vapor), that does not rely on Virtual DOM and takes more advantage of Vue's built-in reactivity system.
