### Checkbox {#checkbox-1}

```vue-html
<input
  type="checkbox"
  v-model="toggle"
  true-value="yes"
  false-value="no" />
```

`true-value` and `false-value` are Vue-specific attributes that only work with `v-model`. Here the `toggle` property's value will be set to `'yes'` when the box is checked, and set to `'no'` when unchecked. You can also bind them to dynamic values using `v-bind`:

```vue-html
<input
  type="checkbox"
  v-model="toggle"
  :true-value="dynamicTrueValue"
  :false-value="dynamicFalseValue" />
```

:::tip Tip
The `true-value` and `false-value` attributes don't affect the input's `value` attribute, because browsers don't include unchecked boxes in form submissions. To guarantee that one of two values is submitted in a form (e.g. "yes" or "no"), use radio inputs instead.
