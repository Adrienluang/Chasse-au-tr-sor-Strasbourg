### Passing Slots {#passing-slots}

Passing children to components works a bit differently from passing children to elements. Instead of an array, we need to pass either a slot function, or an object of slot functions. Slot functions can return anything a normal render function can return - which will always be normalized to arrays of vnodes when accessed in the child component.

```js
// single default slot
h(MyComponent, () => 'hello')

// named slots
// notice the `null` is required to avoid
// the slots object being treated as props
h(MyComponent, null, {
  default: () => 'default slot',
  foo: () => h('div', 'foo'),
  bar: () => [h('span', 'one'), h('span', 'two')]
})
```

JSX equivalent:

```jsx
// default
<MyComponent>{() => 'hello'}</MyComponent>

// named
<MyComponent>{{
  default: () => 'default slot',
  foo: () => <div>foo</div>,
  bar: () => [<span>one</span>, <span>two</span>]
}}</MyComponent>
```

Passing slots as functions allows them to be invoked lazily by the child component. This leads to the slot's dependencies being tracked by the child instead of the parent, which results in more accurate and efficient updates.
