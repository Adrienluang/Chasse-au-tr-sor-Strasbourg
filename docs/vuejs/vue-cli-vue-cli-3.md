### Vue CLI {#vue-cli}

[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) is the official webpack-based toolchain for Vue. It is now in maintenance mode and we recommend starting new projects with Vite unless you rely on specific webpack-only features. Vite will provide superior developer experience in most cases.
