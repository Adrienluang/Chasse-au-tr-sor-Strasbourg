### Return Values {#return-values}

You have probably noticed that we have been exclusively using `ref()` instead of `reactive()` in composables. The recommended convention is for composables to always return a plain, non-reactive object containing multiple refs. This allows it to be destructured in components while retaining reactivity:

```js
// x and y are refs
const { x, y } = useMouse()
```

Returning a reactive object from a composable will cause such destructures to lose the reactivity connection to the state inside the composable, while the refs will retain that connection.

If you prefer to use returned state from composables as object properties, you can wrap the returned object with `reactive()` so that the refs are unwrapped. For example:

```js
const mouse = reactive(useMouse())
// mouse.x is linked to original ref
console.log(mouse.x)
```

```vue-html
Mouse position is at: {{ mouse.x }}, {{ mouse.y }}
```
