### Recommendation {#recommendation-2}

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a great E2E testing solution that supports Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. It has an informative UI, excellent debuggability, built-in assertions, parallelization, traces and is designed to eliminate flaky tests. Support for [Component Testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) is available, but marked experimental. Playwright is open source and maintained by Microsoft.

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has an informative graphical interface, excellent debuggability, built-in assertions, stubs, flake-resistance, and snapshots. As mentioned above, it provides stable support for [Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/introduction). Cypress supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Electron. WebKit support is available, but marked experimental. Cypress is MIT-licensed, but some features like parallelization require a subscription to Cypress Cloud.
