### Attribute bindings {#attribute-bindings}

Similarly, dynamic attribute bindings are also automatically escaped. That means in this template:

```vue-html
<h1 :title="userProvidedString">
  hello
</h1>
```

if `userProvidedString` contained:

```js
'" onclick="alert(\'hi\')'
```

then it would be escaped to the following HTML:

```vue-html
&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('hi')
```

thus preventing the close of the `title` attribute to inject new, arbitrary HTML. This escaping is done using native browser APIs, like `setAttribute`, so a vulnerability can only exist if the browser itself is vulnerable.

## Potential Dangers {#potential-dangers}

In any web application, allowing unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is potentially dangerous, so it should be avoided wherever possible. There are times when some risk may be acceptable, though.

For example, services like CodePen and JSFiddle allow user-provided content to be executed, but it's in a context where this is expected and sandboxed to some extent inside iframes. In the cases when an important feature inherently requires some level of vulnerability, it's up to your team to weigh the importance of the feature against the worst-case scenarios the vulnerability enables.
