### Other Options {#other-options-1}

- [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org/) is an E2E test runner with Vue Component Testing support. ([Example Project](https://github.com/nightwatchjs-community/todo-vue))

- [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/component-testing/vue) for cross-browser component testing that relies on native user interaction based on standardized automation. It can also be used with Testing Library.

## E2E Testing {#e2e-testing}

While unit tests provide developers with some degree of confidence, unit and component tests are limited in their abilities to provide holistic coverage of an application when deployed to production. As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.

End-to-end tests focus on multi-page application behavior that makes network requests against your production-built Vue application. They often involve standing up a database or other backend and may even be run against a live staging environment.

End-to-end tests will often catch issues with your router, state management library, top-level components (e.g. an App or Layout), public assets, or any request handling. As stated above, they catch critical issues that may be impossible to catch with unit tests or component tests.

End-to-end tests do not import any of your Vue application's code but instead rely completely on testing your application by navigating through entire pages in a real browser.

End-to-end tests validate many of the layers in your application. They can either target your locally built application or even a live Staging environment. Testing against your Staging environment not only includes your frontend code and static server but all associated backend services and infrastructure.

By testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not.
