### Client Hydration {#client-hydration}

If you click the button, you'll notice the number doesn't change. The HTML is completely static on the client since we are not loading Vue in the browser.

To make the client-side app interactive, Vue needs to perform the **hydration** step. During hydration, it creates the same Vue application that was run on the server, matches each component to the DOM nodes it should control, and attaches DOM event listeners.

To mount an app in hydration mode, we need to use [`createSSRApp()`](/api/application#createssrapp) instead of `createApp()`:

```js{2}
// this runs in the browser.
import { createSSRApp } from 'vue'

const app = createSSRApp({
  // ...same app as on server
})

// mounting an SSR app on the client assumes
// the HTML was pre-rendered and will perform
// hydration instead of mounting new DOM nodes.
app.mount('#app')
```
