### Hiding Content {#hiding-content}

Usually it is not recommended to visually hide labels, even if the input has an accessible name. However, if the functionality of the input can be understood with surrounding content, then we can hide the visual label.

Let's look at this search field:

```vue-html
<form role="search">
  <label for="search" class="hidden-visually">Search: </label>
  <input type="text" name="search" id="search" v-model="search" />
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
```

We can do this because the search button will help visual users identify the purpose of the input field.

We can use CSS to visually hide elements but keep them available for assistive technology:

```css
.hidden-visually {
  position: absolute;
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(100%);
}
```

#### `aria-hidden="true"` {#aria-hidden-true}

Adding `aria-hidden="true"` will hide the element from assistive technology but leave it visually available for other users. Do not use it on focusable elements, purely on decorative, duplicated or offscreen content.

```vue-html
<p>This is not hidden from screen readers.</p>
<p aria-hidden="true">This is hidden from screen readers.</p>
```
