### Vite {#vite}

[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a lightweight and fast build tool with first-class Vue SFC support. It is created by Evan You, who is also the author of Vue!

To get started with Vite + Vue, simply run:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm create vue@latest
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm create vue@latest
```
  
```sh [yarn]
# For Yarn Modern (v2+)
$ yarn create vue@latest
  
# For Yarn ^v4.11
$ yarn dlx create-vue@latest
```
  
```sh [bun]
$ bun create vue@latest
```

:::

This command will install and execute [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), the official Vue project scaffolding tool.

- To learn more about Vite, check out the [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/).
- To configure Vue-specific behavior in a Vite project, for example passing options to the Vue compiler, check out the docs for [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#readme).

Both online playgrounds mentioned above also support downloading files as a Vite project.
