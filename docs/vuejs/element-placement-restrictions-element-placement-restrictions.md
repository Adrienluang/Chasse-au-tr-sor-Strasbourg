### Element Placement Restrictions {#element-placement-restrictions}

Some HTML elements, such as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>` and `<select>` have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as `<li>`, `<tr>`, and `<option>` can only appear inside certain other elements.

This will lead to issues when using components with elements that have such restrictions. For example:

```vue-html
<table>
  <blog-post-row></blog-post-row>
</table>
```

The custom component `<blog-post-row>` will be hoisted out as invalid content, causing errors in the eventual rendered output. We can use the special [`is` attribute](/api/built-in-special-attributes#is) as a workaround:

```vue-html
<table>
  <tr is="vue:blog-post-row"></tr>
</table>
```

:::tip
When used on native HTML elements, the value of `is` must be prefixed with `vue:` in order to be interpreted as a Vue component. This is required to avoid confusion with native [customized built-in elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example).

That's all you need to know about in-DOM template parsing caveats for now - and actually, the end of Vue's _Essentials_. Congratulations! There's still more to learn, but first, we recommend taking a break to play with Vue yourself - build something fun, or check out some of the [Examples](/examples/) if you haven't already.

Once you feel comfortable with the knowledge you've just digested, move on with the guide to learn more about components in depth.

# Composables {#composables}

<script setup>
import { useMouse } from './mouse'
const { x, y } = useMouse()
</script>

:::tip
This section assumes basic knowledge of Composition API. If you have been learning Vue with Options API only, you can set the API Preference to Composition API (using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar) and re-read the [Reactivity Fundamentals](/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) and [Lifecycle Hooks](/guide/essentials/lifecycle) chapters.
:::

## What is a "Composable"? {#what-is-a-composable}

In the context of Vue applications, a "composable" is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API to encapsulate and reuse **stateful logic**.

When building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulates **stateless logic**: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), which you may have heard of.

By contrast, stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time. A simple example would be tracking the current position of the mouse on a page. In real-world scenarios, it could also be more complex logic such as touch gestures or connection status to a database.

## Mouse Tracker Example {#mouse-tracker-example}

If we were to implement the mouse tracking functionality using the Composition API directly inside a component, it would look like this:

```vue [MouseComponent.vue]
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

const x = ref(0)
const y = ref(0)

function update(event) {
  x.value = event.pageX
  y.value = event.pageY
}

onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))
onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))
</script>

<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>
```

But what if we want to reuse the same logic in multiple components? We can extract the logic into an external file, as a composable function:

```js [mouse.js]
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

// by convention, composable function names start with "use"
export function useMouse() {
  // state encapsulated and managed by the composable
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  // a composable can update its managed state over time.
  function update(event) {
    x.value = event.pageX
    y.value = event.pageY
  }

  // a composable can also hook into its owner component's
  // lifecycle to setup and teardown side effects.
  onMounted(() => window.addEventListener('mousemove', update))
  onUnmounted(() => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', update))

  // expose managed state as return value
  return { x, y }
}
```

And this is how it can be used in components:

```vue [MouseComponent.vue]
<script setup>
import { useMouse } from './mouse.js'

const { x, y } = useMouse()
</script>

<template>Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}</template>
```

<div class="demo">
  Mouse position is at: {{ x }}, {{ y }}
</div>

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqNkj1rwzAQhv/KocUOGKVzSAIdurVjoQUvJj4XlfgkJNmxMfrvPcmJkkKHLrbu69H7SlrEszFyHFDsxN6drDIeHPrBHGtSvdHWwwKDwzfNHwjQWd1DIbd9jOW3K2qq6aTJxb6pgpl7Dnmg3NS0365YBnLgsTfnxiNHACvUaKe80gTKQeN3sDAIQqjignEhIvKYqMRta1acFVrsKtDEQPLYxuU7cV8Msmg2mdTilIa6gU5p27tYWKKq1c3ENphaPrGFW25+yMXsHWFaFlfiiOSvFIBJjs15QJ5JeWmaL/xYS/Mfpc9YYrPxl52ULOpwhIuiVl9k07Yvsf9VOY+EtizSWfR6xKK6itgkvQ/+fyNs6v4XJXIsPwVL+WprCiL8AEUxw5s=)

As we can see, the core logic remains identical - all we had to do was move it into an external function and return the state that should be exposed. Just like inside a component, you can use the full range of [Composition API functions](/api/#composition-api) in composables. The same `useMouse()` functionality can now be used in any component.

The cooler part about composables though, is that you can also nest them: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units, similar to how we compose an entire application using components. In fact, this is why we decided to call the collection of APIs that make this pattern possible Composition API.

For example, we can extract the logic of adding and removing a DOM event listener into its own composable:

```js [event.js]
import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

export function useEventListener(target, event, callback) {
  // if you want, you can also make this
  // support selector strings as target
  onMounted(() => target.addEventListener(event, callback))
  onUnmounted(() => target.removeEventListener(event, callback))
}
```

And now our `useMouse()` composable can be simplified to:

```js{2,8-11} [mouse.js]
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useEventListener } from './event'

export function useMouse() {
  const x = ref(0)
  const y = ref(0)

  useEventListener(window, 'mousemove', (event) => {
    x.value = event.pageX
    y.value = event.pageY
  })

  return { x, y }
}
```

:::tip
Each component instance calling `useMouse()` will create its own copies of `x` and `y` state so they won't interfere with one another. If you want to manage shared state between components, read the [State Management](/guide/scaling-up/state-management) chapter.
:::

## Async State Example {#async-state-example}

The `useMouse()` composable doesn't take any arguments, so let's take a look at another example that makes use of one. When doing async data fetching, we often need to handle different states: loading, success, and error:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const data = ref(null)
const error = ref(null)

fetch('...')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((json) => (data.value = json))
  .catch((err) => (error.value = err))
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="error">Oops! Error encountered: {{ error.message }}</div>
  <div v-else-if="data">
    Data loaded:
    <pre>{{ data }}</pre>
  </div>
  <div v-else>Loading...</div>
</template>
```

It would be tedious to have to repeat this pattern in every component that needs to fetch data. Let's extract it into a composable:

```js [fetch.js]
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useFetch(url) {
  const data = ref(null)
  const error = ref(null)

  fetch(url)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((json) => (data.value = json))
    .catch((err) => (error.value = err))

  return { data, error }
}
```

Now in our component we can just do:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useFetch } from './fetch.js'

const { data, error } = useFetch('...')
</script>
```
