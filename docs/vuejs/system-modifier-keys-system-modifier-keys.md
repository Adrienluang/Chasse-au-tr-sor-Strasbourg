### System Modifier Keys {#system-modifier-keys}

You can use the following modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners only when the corresponding modifier key is pressed:

- `.ctrl`
- `.alt`
- `.shift`
- `.meta`

::: tip Note
On Macintosh keyboards, meta is the command key (⌘). On Windows keyboards, meta is the Windows key (⊞). On Sun Microsystems keyboards, meta is marked as a solid diamond (◆). On certain keyboards, specifically MIT and Lisp machine keyboards and successors, such as the Knight keyboard, space-cadet keyboard, meta is labeled “META”. On Symbolics keyboards, meta is labeled “META” or “Meta”.

For example:

```vue-html
<!-- Alt + Enter -->
<input @keyup.alt.enter="clear" />

<!-- Ctrl + Click -->
<div @click.ctrl="doSomething">Do something</div>
```

::: tip
Note that modifier keys are different from regular keys and when used with `keyup` events, they have to be pressed when the event is emitted. In other words, `keyup.ctrl` will only trigger if you release a key while holding down `ctrl`. It won't trigger if you release the `ctrl` key alone.
