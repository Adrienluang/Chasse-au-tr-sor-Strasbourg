### Getters should be side-effect free {#getters-should-be-side-effect-free}

It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, **don't mutate other state, make async requests, or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!** Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes with [watchers](./watchers).
