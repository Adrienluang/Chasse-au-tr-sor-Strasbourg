### Avoid Unnecessary Component Abstractions {#avoid-unnecessary-component-abstractions}

Sometimes we may create [renderless components](/guide/components/slots#renderless-components) or higher-order components (i.e. components that render other components with extra props) for better abstraction or code organization. While there is nothing wrong with this, do keep in mind that component instances are much more expensive than plain DOM nodes, and creating too many of them due to abstraction patterns will incur performance costs.

Note that reducing only a few instances won't have noticeable effect, so don't sweat it if the component is rendered only a few times in the app. The best scenario to consider this optimization is again in large lists. Imagine a list of 100 items where each item component contains many child components. Removing one unnecessary component abstraction here could result in a reduction of hundreds of component instances.

# Priority A Rules: Essential {#priority-a-rules-essential}

::: warning Note
This Vue.js Style Guide is outdated and needs to be reviewed. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs/issues/new).
:::

These rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs. Exceptions may exist, but should be very rare and only be made by those with expert knowledge of both JavaScript and Vue.

## Use multi-word component names {#use-multi-word-component-names}

User component names should always be multi-word, except for root `App` components. This [prevents conflicts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name) with existing and future HTML elements, since all HTML elements are a single word.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- in pre-compiled templates -->
<Item />

<!-- in in-DOM templates -->
<item></item>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- in pre-compiled templates -->
<TodoItem />

<!-- in in-DOM templates -->
<todo-item></todo-item>
```

</div>

## Use detailed prop definitions {#use-detailed-prop-definitions}

In committed code, prop definitions should always be as detailed as possible, specifying at least type(s).

::: details Detailed Explanation
Detailed [prop definitions](/guide/components/props#prop-validation) have two advantages:

- They document the API of the component, so that it's easy to see how the component is meant to be used.
- In development, Vue will warn you if a component is ever provided incorrectly formatted props, helping you catch potential sources of error.
  :::

<div class="options-api">

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```js
// This is only OK when prototyping
props: ['status']
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```js
props: {
  status: String
}
```

```js
// Even better!
props: {
  status: {
    type: String,
    required: true,

    validator: value => {
      return [
        'syncing',
        'synced',
        'version-conflict',
        'error'
      ].includes(value)
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```js
// This is only OK when prototyping
const props = defineProps(['status'])
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```js
const props = defineProps({
  status: String
})
```

```js
// Even better!

const props = defineProps({
  status: {
    type: String,
    required: true,

    validator: (value) => {
      return ['syncing', 'synced', 'version-conflict', 'error'].includes(
        value
      )
    }
  }
})
```

</div>

</div>

## Use keyed `v-for` {#use-keyed-v-for}

`key` with `v-for` is _always_ required on components, in order to maintain internal component state down the subtree. Even for elements though, it's a good practice to maintain predictable behavior, such as [object constancy](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/) in animations.

::: details Detailed Explanation
Let's say you have a list of todos:

<div class="options-api">

```js
data() {
  return {
    todos: [
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Learn to use v-for'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Learn to use key'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
const todos = ref([
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Learn to use v-for'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: 'Learn to use key'
  }
])
```

</div>

Then you sort them alphabetically. When updating the DOM, Vue will optimize rendering to perform the cheapest DOM mutations possible. That might mean deleting the first todo element, then adding it again at the end of the list.

The problem is, there are cases where it's important not to delete elements that will remain in the DOM. For example, you may want to use `<transition-group>` to animate list sorting, or maintain focus if the rendered element is an `<input>`. In these cases, adding a unique key for each item (e.g. `:key="todo.id"`) will tell Vue how to behave more predictably.

In our experience, it's better to _always_ add a unique key, so that you and your team simply never have to worry about these edge cases. Then in the rare, performance-critical scenarios where object constancy isn't necessary, you can make a conscious exception.
:::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li v-for="todo in todos">
    {{ todo.text }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="todo in todos"
    :key="todo.id"
  >
    {{ todo.text }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

</div>

## Avoid `v-if` with `v-for` {#avoid-v-if-with-v-for}

**Never use `v-if` on the same element as `v-for`.**

There are two common cases where this can be tempting:

- To filter items in a list (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="user.isActive"`). In these cases, replace `users` with a new computed property that returns your filtered list (e.g. `activeUsers`).

- To avoid rendering a list if it should be hidden (e.g. `v-for="user in users" v-if="shouldShowUsers"`). In these cases, move the `v-if` to a container element (e.g. `ul`, `ol`).

::: details Detailed Explanation
When Vue processes directives, `v-if` has a higher priority than `v-for`, so that this template:

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="user in users"
    v-if="user.isActive"
    :key="user.id"
  >
    {{ user.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

Will throw an error, because the `v-if` directive will be evaluated first and the iteration variable `user` does not exist at this moment.

This could be fixed by iterating over a computed property instead, like this:

<div class="options-api">

```js
computed: {
  activeUsers() {
    return this.users.filter(user => user.isActive)
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
const activeUsers = computed(() => {
  return users.filter((user) => user.isActive)
})
```

</div>

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="user in activeUsers"
    :key="user.id"
  >
    {{ user.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

Alternatively, we can use a `<template>` tag with `v-for` to wrap the `<li>` element:

```vue-html
<ul>
  <template v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
    <li v-if="user.isActive">
      {{ user.name }}
    </li>
  </template>
</ul>
```

:::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="user in users"
    v-if="user.isActive"
    :key="user.id"
  >
    {{ user.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="user in activeUsers"
    :key="user.id"
  >
    {{ user.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

```vue-html
<ul>
  <template v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
    <li v-if="user.isActive">
      {{ user.name }}
    </li>
  </template>
</ul>
```

</div>

## Use component-scoped styling {#use-component-scoped-styling}

For applications, styles in a top-level `App` component and in layout components may be global, but all other components should always be scoped.

This is only relevant for [Single-File Components](/guide/scaling-up/sfc). It does _not_ require that the [`scoped` attribute](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html) be used. Scoping could be through [CSS modules](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/css-modules.html), a class-based strategy such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/), or another library/convention.

**Component libraries, however, should prefer a class-based strategy instead of using the `scoped` attribute.**

This makes overriding internal styles easier, with human-readable class names that don't have too high specificity, but are still very unlikely to result in a conflict.

::: details Detailed Explanation
If you are developing a large project, working with other developers, or sometimes include 3rd-party HTML/CSS (e.g. from Auth0), consistent scoping will ensure that your styles only apply to the components they are meant for.

Beyond the `scoped` attribute, using unique class names can help ensure that 3rd-party CSS does not apply to your own HTML. For example, many projects use the `button`, `btn`, or `icon` class names, so even if not using a strategy such as BEM, adding an app-specific and/or component-specific prefix (e.g. `ButtonClose-icon`) can provide some protection.
:::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<template>
  <button class="btn btn-close">×</button>
</template>

<style>
.btn-close {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<template>
  <button class="button button-close">×</button>
</template>

<!-- Using the `scoped` attribute -->
<style scoped>
.button {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.button-close {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

```vue-html
<template>
  <button :class="[$style.button, $style.buttonClose]">×</button>
</template>

<!-- Using CSS modules -->
<style module>
.button {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.buttonClose {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

```vue-html
<template>
  <button class="c-Button c-Button--close">×</button>
</template>

<!-- Using the BEM convention -->
<style>
.c-Button {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 2px;
}

.c-Button--close {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

# Priority B Rules: Strongly Recommended {#priority-b-rules-strongly-recommended}

::: warning Note
This Vue.js Style Guide is outdated and needs to be reviewed. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs/issues/new).
:::

These rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.

## Component files {#component-files}

**Whenever a build system is available to concatenate files, each component should be in its own file.**

This helps you to more quickly find a component when you need to edit it or review how to use it.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```js
app.component('TodoList', {
  // ...
})

app.component('TodoItem', {
  // ...
})
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- TodoList.js
|- TodoItem.js
```

```
components/
|- TodoList.vue
|- TodoItem.vue
```

</div>

## Single-file component filename casing {#single-file-component-filename-casing}

**Filenames of [Single-File Components](/guide/scaling-up/sfc) should either be always PascalCase or always kebab-case.**

PascalCase works best with autocompletion in code editors, as it's consistent with how we reference components in JS(X) and templates, wherever possible. However, mixed case filenames can sometimes create issues on case-insensitive file systems, which is why kebab-case is also perfectly acceptable.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```
components/
|- mycomponent.vue
```

```
components/
|- myComponent.vue
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- MyComponent.vue
```

```
components/
|- my-component.vue
```

</div>

## Base component names {#base-component-names}

**Base components (a.k.a. presentational, dumb, or pure components) that apply app-specific styling and conventions should all begin with a specific prefix, such as `Base`, `App`, or `V`.**

::: details Detailed Explanation
These components lay the foundation for consistent styling and behavior in your application. They may **only** contain:

- HTML elements,
- other base components, and
- 3rd-party UI components.

But they'll **never** contain global state (e.g. from a [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) store).

Their names often include the name of an element they wrap (e.g. `BaseButton`, `BaseTable`), unless no element exists for their specific purpose (e.g. `BaseIcon`). If you build similar components for a more specific context, they will almost always consume these components (e.g. `BaseButton` may be used in `ButtonSubmit`).

Some advantages of this convention:

- When organized alphabetically in editors, your app's base components are all listed together, making them easier to identify.

- Since component names should always be multi-word, this convention prevents you from having to choose an arbitrary prefix for simple component wrappers (e.g. `MyButton`, `VueButton`).

- Since these components are so frequently used, you may want to simply make them global instead of importing them everywhere. A prefix makes this possible with Webpack:

  ```js
  const requireComponent = require.context(
    './src',
    true,
    /Base[A-Z]\w+\.(vue|js)$/
  )
  requireComponent.keys().forEach(function (fileName) {
    let baseComponentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)
    baseComponentConfig =
      baseComponentConfig.default || baseComponentConfig
    const baseComponentName =
      baseComponentConfig.name ||
      fileName.replace(/^.+\//, '').replace(/\.\w+$/, '')
    app.component(baseComponentName, baseComponentConfig)
  })
  ```

  :::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```
components/
|- MyButton.vue
|- VueTable.vue
|- Icon.vue
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- BaseButton.vue
|- BaseTable.vue
|- BaseIcon.vue
```

```
components/
|- AppButton.vue
|- AppTable.vue
|- AppIcon.vue
```

```
components/
|- VButton.vue
|- VTable.vue
|- VIcon.vue
```

</div>

## Tightly coupled component names {#tightly-coupled-component-names}

**Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix.**

If a component only makes sense in the context of a single parent component, that relationship should be evident in its name. Since editors typically organize files alphabetically, this also keeps these related files next to each other.

::: details Detailed Explanation
You might be tempted to solve this problem by nesting child components in directories named after their parent. For example:

```
components/
|- TodoList/
   |- Item/
      |- index.vue
      |- Button.vue
   |- index.vue
```

or:

```
components/
|- TodoList/
   |- Item/
      |- Button.vue
   |- Item.vue
|- TodoList.vue
```

This isn't recommended, as it results in:

- Many files with similar names, making rapid file switching in code editors more difficult.
- Many nested sub-directories, which increases the time it takes to browse components in an editor's sidebar.
  :::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```
components/
|- TodoList.vue
|- TodoItem.vue
|- TodoButton.vue
```

```
components/
|- SearchSidebar.vue
|- NavigationForSearchSidebar.vue
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- TodoList.vue
|- TodoListItem.vue
|- TodoListItemButton.vue
```

```
components/
|- SearchSidebar.vue
|- SearchSidebarNavigation.vue
```

</div>

## Order of words in component names {#order-of-words-in-component-names}

**Component names should start with the highest-level (often most general) words and end with descriptive modifying words.**

::: details Detailed Explanation
You may be wondering:

> "Why would we force component names to use less natural language?"

In natural English, adjectives and other descriptors do typically appear before the nouns, while exceptions require connector words. For example:

- Coffee _with_ milk
- Soup _of the_ day
- Visitor _to the_ museum

You can definitely include these connector words in component names if you'd like, but the order is still important.

Also note that **what's considered "highest-level" will be contextual to your app**. For example, imagine an app with a search form. It may include components like this one:

```
components/
|- ClearSearchButton.vue
|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue
|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue
|- RunSearchButton.vue
|- SearchInput.vue
|- TermsCheckbox.vue
```

As you might notice, it's quite difficult to see which components are specific to the search. Now let's rename the components according to the rule:

```
components/
|- SearchButtonClear.vue
|- SearchButtonRun.vue
|- SearchInputExcludeGlob.vue
|- SearchInputQuery.vue
|- SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.vue
|- SettingsCheckboxTerms.vue
```

Since editors typically organize files alphabetically, all the important relationships between components are now evident at a glance.

You might be tempted to solve this problem differently, nesting all the search components under a "search" directory, then all the settings components under a "settings" directory. We only recommend considering this approach in very large apps (e.g. 100+ components), for these reasons:

- It generally takes more time to navigate through nested sub-directories, than scrolling through a single `components` directory.
- Name conflicts (e.g. multiple `ButtonDelete.vue` components) make it more difficult to quickly navigate to a specific component in a code editor.
- Refactoring becomes more difficult, because find-and-replace often isn't sufficient to update relative references to a moved component.
  :::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```
components/
|- ClearSearchButton.vue
|- ExcludeFromSearchInput.vue
|- LaunchOnStartupCheckbox.vue
|- RunSearchButton.vue
|- SearchInput.vue
|- TermsCheckbox.vue
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- SearchButtonClear.vue
|- SearchButtonRun.vue
|- SearchInputQuery.vue
|- SearchInputExcludeGlob.vue
|- SettingsCheckboxTerms.vue
|- SettingsCheckboxLaunchOnStartup.vue
```

</div>

## Self-closing components {#self-closing-components}

**Components with no content should be self-closing in [Single-File Components](/guide/scaling-up/sfc), string templates, and [JSX](/guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) - but never in in-DOM templates.**

Components that self-close communicate that they not only have no content, but are **meant** to have no content. It's the difference between a blank page in a book and one labeled "This page intentionally left blank." Your code is also cleaner without the unnecessary closing tag.

Unfortunately, HTML doesn't allow custom elements to be self-closing - only [official "void" elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html#void-elements). That's why the strategy is only possible when Vue's template compiler can reach the template before the DOM, then serve the DOM spec-compliant HTML.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- In Single-File Components, string templates, and JSX -->
<MyComponent></MyComponent>
```

```vue-html
<!-- In in-DOM templates -->
<my-component/>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- In Single-File Components, string templates, and JSX -->
<MyComponent/>
```

```vue-html
<!-- In in-DOM templates -->
<my-component></my-component>
```

</div>

## Component name casing in templates {#component-name-casing-in-templates}

**In most projects, component names should always be PascalCase in [Single-File Components](/guide/scaling-up/sfc) and string templates - but kebab-case in in-DOM templates.**

PascalCase has a few advantages over kebab-case:

- Editors can autocomplete component names in templates, because PascalCase is also used in JavaScript.
- `<MyComponent>` is more visually distinct from a single-word HTML element than `<my-component>`, because there are two character differences (the two capitals), rather than just one (a hyphen).
- If you use any non-Vue custom elements in your templates, such as a web component, PascalCase ensures that your Vue components remain distinctly visible.

Unfortunately, due to HTML's case insensitivity, in-DOM templates must still use kebab-case.

Also note that if you've already invested heavily in kebab-case, consistency with HTML conventions and being able to use the same casing across all your projects may be more important than the advantages listed above. In those cases, **using kebab-case everywhere is also acceptable.**

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->
<mycomponent/>
```

```vue-html
<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->
<myComponent/>
```

```vue-html
<!-- In in-DOM templates -->
<MyComponent></MyComponent>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- In Single-File Components and string templates -->
<MyComponent/>
```

```vue-html
<!-- In in-DOM templates -->
<my-component></my-component>
```

OR

```vue-html
<!-- Everywhere -->
<my-component></my-component>
```

</div>

## Component name casing in JS/JSX {#component-name-casing-in-js-jsx}

**Component names in JS/[JSX](/guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) should always be PascalCase, though they may be kebab-case inside strings for simpler applications that only use global component registration through `app.component`.**

::: details Detailed Explanation
In JavaScript, PascalCase is the convention for classes and prototype constructors - essentially, anything that can have distinct instances. Vue components also have instances, so it makes sense to also use PascalCase. As an added benefit, using PascalCase within JSX (and templates) allows readers of the code to more easily distinguish between components and HTML elements.

However, for applications that use **only** global component definitions via `app.component`, we recommend kebab-case instead. The reasons are:

- It's rare that global components are ever referenced in JavaScript, so following a convention for JavaScript makes less sense.
- These applications always include many in-DOM templates, where [kebab-case **must** be used](#component-name-casing-in-templates).
  :::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```js
app.component('myComponent', {
  // ...
})
```

```js
import myComponent from './MyComponent.vue'
```

```js
export default {
  name: 'myComponent'
  // ...
}
```

```js
export default {
  name: 'my-component'
  // ...
}
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```js
app.component('MyComponent', {
  // ...
})
```

```js
app.component('my-component', {
  // ...
})
```

```js
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'
```

```js
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent'
  // ...
}
```

</div>

## Full-word component names {#full-word-component-names}

**Component names should prefer full words over abbreviations.**

The autocompletion in editors make the cost of writing longer names very low, while the clarity they provide is invaluable. Uncommon abbreviations, in particular, should always be avoided.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```
components/
|- SdSettings.vue
|- UProfOpts.vue
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```
components/
|- StudentDashboardSettings.vue
|- UserProfileOptions.vue
```

</div>

## Prop name casing {#prop-name-casing}

**Prop names should always use camelCase during declaration. When used inside in-DOM templates, props should be kebab-cased. Single-File Components templates and [JSX](/guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) can use either kebab-case or camelCase props. Casing should be consistent - if you choose to use camelCased props, make sure you don't use kebab-cased ones in your application**

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

<div class="options-api">

```js
props: {
  'greeting-text': String
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
const props = defineProps({
  'greeting-text': String
})
```

</div>

```vue-html
// for in-DOM templates
<welcome-message greetingText="hi"></welcome-message>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

<div class="options-api">

```js
props: {
  greetingText: String
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
const props = defineProps({
  greetingText: String
})
```

</div>

```vue-html
// for SFC - please make sure your casing is consistent throughout the project
// you can use either convention but we don't recommend mixing two different casing styles
<WelcomeMessage greeting-text="hi"/>
// or
<WelcomeMessage greetingText="hi"/>
```

```vue-html
// for in-DOM templates
<welcome-message greeting-text="hi"></welcome-message>
```

</div>

## Multi-attribute elements {#multi-attribute-elements}

**Elements with multiple attributes should span multiple lines, with one attribute per line.**

In JavaScript, splitting objects with multiple properties over multiple lines is widely considered a good convention, because it's much easier to read. Our templates and [JSX](/guide/extras/render-function#jsx-tsx) deserve the same consideration.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<img src="https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png" alt="Vue Logo">
```

```vue-html
<MyComponent foo="a" bar="b" baz="c"/>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html

## Simple expressions in templates {#simple-expressions-in-templates}

**Component templates should only include simple expressions, with more complex expressions refactored into computed properties or methods.**

Complex expressions in your templates make them less declarative. We should strive to describe _what_ should appear, not _how_ we're computing that value. Computed properties and methods also allow the code to be reused.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
{{
  fullName.split(' ').map((word) => {
    return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
  }).join(' ')
}}
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<!-- In a template -->
{{ normalizedFullName }}
```

<div class="options-api">

```js
// The complex expression has been moved to a computed property
computed: {
  normalizedFullName() {
    return this.fullName.split(' ')
      .map(word => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
      .join(' ')
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
// The complex expression has been moved to a computed property
const normalizedFullName = computed(() =>
  fullName.value
    .split(' ')
    .map((word) => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .join(' ')
)
```

</div>

</div>

## Simple computed properties {#simple-computed-properties}

**Complex computed properties should be split into as many simpler properties as possible.**

::: details Detailed Explanation
Simpler, well-named computed properties are:

- **Easier to test**

  When each computed property contains only a very simple expression, with very few dependencies, it's much easier to write tests confirming that it works correctly.

- **Easier to read**

  Simplifying computed properties forces you to give each value a descriptive name, even if it's not reused. This makes it much easier for other developers (and future you) to focus in on the code they care about and figure out what's going on.

- **More adaptable to changing requirements**

  Any value that can be named might be useful to the view. For example, we might decide to display a message telling the user how much money they saved. We might also decide to calculate sales tax, but perhaps display it separately, rather than as part of the final price.

  Small, focused computed properties make fewer assumptions about how information will be used, so require less refactoring as requirements change.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

<div class="options-api">

```js
computed: {
  price() {
    const basePrice = this.manufactureCost / (1 - this.profitMargin)
    return (
      basePrice -
      basePrice * (this.discountPercent || 0)
    )
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

```js
const price = computed(() => {
  const basePrice = manufactureCost.value / (1 - profitMargin.value)
  return basePrice - basePrice * (discountPercent.value || 0)

    return this.basePrice - this.discount
  }

```js
const basePrice = computed(

)

const finalPrice = computed(() => basePrice.value - discount.value)
```

</div>

</div>

## Quoted attribute values {#quoted-attribute-values}

**Non-empty HTML attribute values should always be inside quotes (single or double, whichever is not used in JS).**

While attribute values without any spaces are not required to have quotes in HTML, this practice often leads to _avoiding_ spaces, making attribute values less readable.

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<input type=text>
```

```vue-html
<AppSidebar :style={width:sidebarWidth+'px'}>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<input type="text">
```

```vue-html
<AppSidebar :style="{ width: sidebarWidth + 'px' }">
```

</div>

## Directive shorthands {#directive-shorthands}

**Directive shorthands (`:` for `v-bind:`, `@` for `v-on:` and `#` for `v-slot`) should be used always or never.**

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<input
  v-bind:value="newTodoText"
  :placeholder="newTodoInstructions"
>
```

```vue-html
<input
  v-on:input="onInput"
  @focus="onFocus"
>
```

```vue-html
<template v-slot:header>
  <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
</template>

<template #footer>
  <p>Here's some contact info</p>
</template>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">

```

```vue-html

  @input="onInput"
  @focus="onFocus"
>
```

```vue-html

  v-on:focus="onFocus"
>
```

```vue-html
<template v-slot:header>
  <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
</template>

<template v-slot:footer>
  <p>Here's some contact info</p>
</template>
```

```vue-html

# Priority C Rules: Recommended {#priority-c-rules-recommended}

::: warning Note
This Vue.js Style Guide is outdated and needs to be reviewed. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs/issues/new).
:::

Where multiple, equally good options exist, an arbitrary choice can be made to ensure consistency. In these rules, we describe each acceptable option and suggest a default choice. That means you can feel free to make a different choice in your own codebase, as long as you're consistent and have a good reason. Please do have a good reason though! By adapting to the community standard, you will:

1. Train your brain to more easily parse most of the community code you encounter
2. Be able to copy and paste most community code examples without modification
3. Often find new hires are already accustomed to your preferred coding style, at least in regards to Vue

## Component/instance options order {#component-instance-options-order}

**Component/instance options should be ordered consistently.**

This is the default order we recommend for component options. They're split into categories, so you'll know where to add new properties from plugins.

1. **Global Awareness** (requires knowledge beyond the component)

   - `name`

2. **Template Compiler Options** (changes the way templates are compiled)

   - `compilerOptions`

3. **Template Dependencies** (assets used in the template)

   - `components`
   - `directives`

4. **Composition** (merges properties into the options)

   - `extends`
   - `mixins`
   - `provide`/`inject`

5. **Interface** (the interface to the component)

   - `inheritAttrs`
   - `props`
   - `emits`

6. **Composition API** (the entry point for using the Composition API)

   - `setup`

7. **Local State** (local reactive properties)

   - `data`
   - `computed`

8. **Events** (callbacks triggered by reactive events)

   - `watch`
   - Lifecycle Events (in the order they are called)
     - `beforeCreate`
     - `created`
     - `beforeMount`
     - `mounted`
     - `beforeUpdate`
     - `updated`
     - `activated`
     - `deactivated`
     - `beforeUnmount`
     - `unmounted`
     - `errorCaptured`
     - `renderTracked`
     - `renderTriggered`

9. **Non-Reactive Properties** (instance properties independent of the reactivity system)

   - `methods`

10. **Rendering** (the declarative description of the component output)
    - `template`/`render`

## Element attribute order {#element-attribute-order}

**The attributes of elements (including components) should be ordered consistently.**

This is the default order we recommend for component options. They're split into categories, so you'll know where to add custom attributes and directives.

1. **Definition** (provides the component options)

   - `is`

2. **List Rendering** (creates multiple variations of the same element)

   - `v-for`

3. **Conditionals** (whether the element is rendered/shown)

   - `v-if`
   - `v-else-if`
   - `v-else`
   - `v-show`
   - `v-cloak`

4. **Render Modifiers** (changes the way the element renders)

   - `v-pre`
   - `v-once`

5. **Global Awareness** (requires knowledge beyond the component)

   - `id`

6. **Unique Attributes** (attributes that require unique values)

   - `ref`
   - `key`

7. **Two-Way Binding** (combining binding and events)

   - `v-model`

8. **Other Attributes** (all unspecified bound & unbound attributes)

9. **Events** (component event listeners)

   - `v-on`

10. **Content** (overrides the content of the element)
    - `v-html`
    - `v-text`

## Empty lines in component/instance options {#empty-lines-in-component-instance-options}

**You may want to add one empty line between multi-line properties, particularly if the options can no longer fit on your screen without scrolling.**

When components begin to feel cramped or difficult to read, adding spaces between multi-line properties can make them easier to skim again. In some editors, such as Vim, formatting options like this can also make them easier to navigate with the keyboard.

<div class="options-api">

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```js
props: {
  value: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },

  focused: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },

  label: String,

    type: Boolean,
    default: false

})

const formattedValue = computed(() => {

```

</div>

</div>

## Single-file component top-level element order {#single-file-component-top-level-element-order}

**[Single-File Components](/guide/scaling-up/sfc) should always order `<script>`, `<template>`, and `<style>` tags consistently, with `<style>` last, because at least one of the other two is always necessary.**

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html [ComponentX.vue]

# Priority D Rules: Use with Caution {#priority-d-rules-use-with-caution}

::: warning Note
This Vue.js Style Guide is outdated and needs to be reviewed. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs/issues/new).
:::

Some features of Vue exist to accommodate rare edge cases or smoother migrations from a legacy code base. When overused however, they can make your code more difficult to maintain or even become a source of bugs. These rules shine a light on potentially risky features, describing when and why they should be avoided.

## Element selectors with `scoped` {#element-selectors-with-scoped}

**Element selectors should be avoided with `scoped`.**

Prefer class selectors over element selectors in `scoped` styles, because large numbers of element selectors are slow.

::: details Detailed Explanation
To scope styles, Vue adds a unique attribute to component elements, such as `data-v-f3f3eg9`. Then selectors are modified so that only matching elements with this attribute are selected (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`).

The problem is that large numbers of element-attribute selectors (e.g. `button[data-v-f3f3eg9]`) will be considerably slower than class-attribute selectors (e.g. `.btn-close[data-v-f3f3eg9]`), so class selectors should be preferred whenever possible.
:::

<div class="style-example style-example-bad">
<h3>Bad</h3>

```vue-html
<template>
  <button>×</button>
</template>

<style scoped>
button {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

</div>

<div class="style-example style-example-good">
<h3>Good</h3>

```vue-html
<template>
  <button class="btn btn-close">×</button>
</template>

<style scoped>
.btn-close {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>
```

</div>

## Implicit parent-child communication {#implicit-parent-child-communication}

**Props and events should be preferred for parent-child component communication, instead of `this.$parent` or mutating props.**

An ideal Vue application is props down, events up. Sticking to this convention makes your components much easier to understand. However, there are edge cases where prop mutation or `this.$parent` can simplify two components that are already deeply coupled.

The problem is, there are also many _simple_ cases where these patterns may offer convenience. Beware: do not be seduced into trading simplicity (being able to understand the flow of your state) for short-term convenience (writing less code).

# Production Deployment {#production-deployment}

## Development vs. Production {#development-vs-production}

During development, Vue provides a number of features to improve the development experience:

- Warning for common errors and pitfalls
- Props / events validation
- [Reactivity debugging hooks](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#reactivity-debugging)
- Devtools integration

However, these features become useless in production. Some of the warning checks can also incur a small amount of performance overhead. When deploying to production, we should drop all the unused, development-only code branches for smaller payload size and better performance.

## Without Build Tools {#without-build-tools}

If you are using Vue without a build tool by loading it from a CDN or self-hosted script, make sure to use the production build (dist files that end in `.prod.js`) when deploying to production. Production builds are pre-minified with all development-only code branches removed.

- If using global build (accessing via the `Vue` global): use `vue.global.prod.js`.
- If using ESM build (accessing via native ESM imports): use `vue.esm-browser.prod.js`.

Consult the [dist file guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use) for more details.

## With Build Tools {#with-build-tools}

Projects scaffolded via `create-vue` (based on Vite) or Vue CLI (based on webpack) are pre-configured for production builds.

If using a custom setup, make sure that:

1. `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.
2. The [compile time feature flags](/api/compile-time-flags) are properly configured.
3. <code>process.env<wbr>.NODE_ENV</code> is replaced with `"production"` during build.

Additional references:

- [Vite production build guide](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html)
- [Vite deployment guide](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
- [Vue CLI deployment guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html)

## Tracking Runtime Errors {#tracking-runtime-errors}

The [app-level error handler](/api/application#app-config-errorhandler) can be used to report errors to tracking services:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp(...)

app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {
  // report error to tracking services
}
```

Services such as [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/) and [Bugsnag](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/vue/) also provide official integrations for Vue.

---

---
url: /error-reference/index.md
---
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { data } from './errors.data.ts'
import ErrorsTable from './ErrorsTable.vue'

const highlight = ref()
onMounted(() => {
  highlight.value = location.hash.slice(1)
})
</script>

# Production Error Code Reference {#error-reference}

## Runtime Errors {#runtime-errors}

In production builds, the 3rd argument passed to the following error handler APIs will be a short code instead of the full information string:

- [`app.config.errorHandler`](/api/application#app-config-errorhandler)
- [`onErrorCaptured`](/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onerrorcaptured) (Composition API)
- [`errorCaptured`](/api/options-lifecycle#errorcaptured) (Options API)

The following table maps the codes to their original full information strings.

<ErrorsTable kind="runtime" :errors="data.runtime" :highlight="highlight" />

## Compiler Errors {#compiler-errors}

The following table provides a mapping of the production compiler error codes to their original messages.

<ErrorsTable kind="compiler" :errors="data.compiler" :highlight="highlight" />

<div class="options-api">
  <VueSchoolLink href="https://vueschool.io/lessons/vue-3-reusable-components-with-props" title="Free Vue.js Props Lesson"/>
</div>

## Props Declaration {#props-declaration}

Vue components require explicit props declaration so that Vue knows what external props passed to the component should be treated as fallthrough attributes (which will be discussed in [its dedicated section](/guide/components/attrs)).

<div class="composition-api">

In SFCs using `<script setup>`, props can be declared using the `defineProps()` macro:

```vue
<script setup>
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

console.log(props.foo)
</script>
```

In non-`<script setup>` components, props are declared using the [`props`](/api/options-state#props) option:

```js
export default {
  props: ['foo'],
  setup(props) {
    // setup() receives props as the first argument.
    console.log(props.foo)
  }
}
```

Notice the argument passed to `defineProps()` is the same as the value provided to the `props` options: the same props options API is shared between the two declaration styles.

</div>

<div class="options-api">

Props are declared using the [`props`](/api/options-state#props) option:

```js
export default {
  props: ['foo'],
  created() {
    // props are exposed on `this`
    console.log(this.foo)
  }
}
```

</div>

In addition to declaring props using an array of strings, we can also use the object syntax:

<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  props: {
    title: String,
    likes: Number
  }
}
```

</div>
<div class="composition-api">

```js
// in <script setup>
defineProps({
  title: String,
  likes: Number
})
```

```js
// in non-<script setup>
export default {
  props: {
    title: String,
    likes: Number
  }
}
```

</div>

For each property in the object declaration syntax, the key is the name of the prop, while the value should be the constructor function of the expected type.

This not only documents your component, but will also warn other developers using your component in the browser console if they pass the wrong type. We will discuss more details about [prop validation](#prop-validation) further down this page.

<div class="options-api">

See also: [Typing Component Props](/guide/typescript/options-api#typing-component-props) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

If you are using TypeScript with `<script setup>`, it's also possible to declare props using pure type annotations:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  title?: string
  likes?: number
}>()
</script>
```

More details: [Typing Component Props](/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-component-props) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

## Reactive Props Destructure <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> \*\* {#reactive-props-destructure}

Vue's reactivity system tracks state usage based on property access. E.g. when you access `props.foo` in a computed getter or a watcher, the `foo` prop gets tracked as a dependency.

So, given the following code:

```js
const { foo } = defineProps(['foo'])

watchEffect(() => {
  // runs only once before 3.5
  // re-runs when the "foo" prop changes in 3.5+
  console.log(foo)
})
```

In version 3.4 and below, `foo` is an actual constant and will never change. In version 3.5 and above, Vue's compiler automatically prepends `props.` when code in the same `<script setup>` block accesses variables destructured from `defineProps`. Therefore the code above becomes equivalent to the following:

```js {5}
const props = defineProps(['foo'])

watchEffect(() => {
  // `foo` transformed to `props.foo` by the compiler
  console.log(props.foo)
})
```

In addition, you can use JavaScript's native default value syntax to declare default values for the props. This is particularly useful when using the type-based props declaration:

```ts
const { foo = 'hello' } = defineProps<{ foo?: string }>()
```

If you prefer to have more visual distinction between destructured props and normal variables in your IDE, Vue's VSCode extension provides a setting to enable inlay-hints for destructured props.
