### Boolean Attributes {#boolean-attributes}

[Boolean attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes) are attributes that can indicate true / false values by their presence on an element. For example, [`disabled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) is one of the most commonly used boolean attributes.

`v-bind` works a bit differently in this case:

```vue-html
<button :disabled="isButtonDisabled">Button</button>
```

The `disabled` attribute will be included if `isButtonDisabled` has a [truthy value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy). It will also be included if the value is an empty string, maintaining consistency with `<button disabled="">`. For other [falsy values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) the attribute will be omitted.
