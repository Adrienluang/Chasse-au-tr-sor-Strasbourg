### Placeholder {#placeholder}

Avoid using placeholders as they can confuse many users.

One of the issues with placeholders is that they don't meet the [color contrast criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) by default; fixing the color contrast makes the placeholder look like pre-populated data in the input fields. Looking at the following example, you can see that the Last Name placeholder which meets the color contrast criteria looks like pre-populated data:

```vue-html
<form
  class="demo"
  action="/dataCollectionLocation"
  method="post"
  autocomplete="on"
>
  <div v-for="item in formItems" :key="item.id" class="form-item">
    <label :for="item.id">{{ item.label }}: </label>
    <input
      type="text"
      :id="item.id"
      :name="item.id"
      v-model="item.value"
      :placeholder="item.placeholder"
    />
  </div>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```css

#lastName::placeholder {
  /* Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari 10.1+ */
  color: black;
  opacity: 1; /* Firefox */
}

#lastName:-ms-input-placeholder {
  /* Internet Explorer 10-11 */
  color: black;
}

#lastName::-ms-input-placeholder {
  /* Microsoft Edge */
  color: black;
}
```

It is best to provide all the information the user needs to fill out forms outside any inputs.
