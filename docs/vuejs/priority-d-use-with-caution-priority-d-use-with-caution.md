### Priority D: Use with Caution {#priority-d-use-with-caution}

Some features of Vue exist to accommodate rare edge cases or smoother migrations from a legacy code base. When overused however, they can make your code more difficult to maintain or even become a source of bugs. These rules shine a light on potentially risky features, describing when and why they should be avoided.

# Suspense {#suspense}

:::warning Experimental Feature
`<Suspense>` is an experimental feature. It is not guaranteed to reach stable status and the API may change before it does.
:::

`<Suspense>` is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.

## Async Dependencies {#async-dependencies}

To explain the problem `<Suspense>` is trying to solve and how it interacts with these async dependencies, let's imagine a component hierarchy like the following:

```
<Suspense>
└─ <Dashboard>
   ├─ <Profile>
   │  └─ <FriendStatus> (component with async setup())
   └─ <Content>
      ├─ <ActivityFeed> (async component)
      └─ <Stats> (async component)
```

In the component tree there are multiple nested components whose rendering depends on some async resource to be resolved first. Without `<Suspense>`, each of them will need to handle its own loading / error and loaded states. In the worst case scenario, we may see three loading spinners on the page, with content displayed at different times.

The `<Suspense>` component gives us the ability to display top-level loading / error states while we wait on these nested async dependencies to be resolved.

There are two types of async dependencies that `<Suspense>` can wait on:

1. Components with an async `setup()` hook. This includes components using `<script setup>` with top-level `await` expressions.

2. [Async Components](/guide/components/async).
