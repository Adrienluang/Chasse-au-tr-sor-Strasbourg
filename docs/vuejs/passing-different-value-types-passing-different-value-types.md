### Passing Different Value Types {#passing-different-value-types}

In the two examples above, we happen to pass string values, but _any_ type of value can be passed to a prop.

#### Number {#number}

```vue-html
<!-- Even though `42` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.       -->
<BlogPost :likes="42" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :likes="post.likes" />
```

#### Boolean {#boolean}

```vue-html
<!-- Including the prop with no value will imply `true`. -->
<BlogPost is-published />

<!-- Even though `false` is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.          -->
<BlogPost :is-published="false" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :is-published="post.isPublished" />
```

#### Array {#array}

```vue-html
<!-- Even though the array is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.            -->
<BlogPost :comment-ids="[234, 266, 273]" />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :comment-ids="post.commentIds" />
```

#### Object {#object}

```vue-html
<!-- Even though the object is static, we need v-bind to tell Vue that -->
<!-- this is a JavaScript expression rather than a string.             -->
<BlogPost
  :author="{
    name: 'Veronica',
    company: 'Veridian Dynamics'
  }"
 />

<!-- Dynamically assign to the value of a variable. -->
<BlogPost :author="post.author" />
```
