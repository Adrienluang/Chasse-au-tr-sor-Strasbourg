### Splitting Up the Modules {#splitting-up-the-modules}

As we dive deeper into the guide, we may need to split our code into separate JavaScript files so that they are easier to manage. For example:

```html [index.html]
<div id="app"></div>

<script type="module">
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import MyComponent from './my-component.js'

  createApp(MyComponent).mount('#app')
</script>
```

<div class="options-api">

```js [my-component.js]
export default {
  data() {
    return { count: 0 }
  },
  template: `<div>Count is: {{ count }}</div>`
}
```

</div>
<div class="composition-api">

```js [my-component.js]
import { ref } from 'vue'
export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)
    return { count }
  },
  template: `<div>Count is: {{ count }}</div>`
}
```

</div>

If you directly open the above `index.html` in your browser, you will find that it throws an error because ES modules cannot work over the `file://` protocol, which is the protocol the browser uses when you open a local file.

Due to security reasons, ES modules can only work over the `http://` protocol, which is what the browsers use when opening pages on the web. In order for ES modules to work on our local machine, we need to serve the `index.html` over the `http://` protocol, with a local HTTP server.

To start a local HTTP server, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then run `npx serve` from the command line in the same directory where your HTML file is. You can also use any other HTTP server that can serve static files with the correct MIME types.

You may have noticed that the imported component's template is inlined as a JavaScript string. If you are using VS Code, you can install the [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) extension and prefix the strings with a `/*html*/` comment to get syntax highlighting for them.

# Reactivity API: Advanced {#reactivity-api-advanced}

## shallowRef() {#shallowref}

Shallow version of [`ref()`](./reactivity-core#ref).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function shallowRef<T>(value: T): ShallowRef<T>

  interface ShallowRef<T> {
    value: T
  }
  ```

- **Details**

  Unlike `ref()`, the inner value of a shallow ref is stored and exposed as-is, and will not be made deeply reactive. Only the `.value` access is reactive.

  `shallowRef()` is typically used for performance optimizations of large data structures, or integration with external state management systems.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const state = shallowRef({ count: 1 })

  // does NOT trigger change
  state.value.count = 2

  // does trigger change
  state.value = { count: 2 }
  ```

- **See also**
  - [Guide - Reduce Reactivity Overhead for Large Immutable Structures](/guide/best-practices/performance#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures)
  - [Guide - Integration with External State Systems](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#integration-with-external-state-systems)

## triggerRef() {#triggerref}

Force trigger effects that depend on a [shallow ref](#shallowref). This is typically used after making deep mutations to the inner value of a shallow ref.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function triggerRef(ref: ShallowRef): void
  ```

- **Example**

  ```js
  const shallow = shallowRef({
    greet: 'Hello, world'
  })

  // Logs "Hello, world" once for the first run-through
  watchEffect(() => {
    console.log(shallow.value.greet)
  })

  // This won't trigger the effect because the ref is shallow
  shallow.value.greet = 'Hello, universe'

  // Logs "Hello, universe"
  triggerRef(shallow)
  ```

## customRef() {#customref}

Creates a customized ref with explicit control over its dependency tracking and updates triggering.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function customRef<T>(factory: CustomRefFactory<T>): Ref<T>

  type CustomRefFactory<T> = (
    track: () => void,
    trigger: () => void
  ) => {
    get: () => T
    set: (value: T) => void
  }
  ```

- **Details**

  `customRef()` expects a factory function, which receives `track` and `trigger` functions as arguments and should return an object with `get` and `set` methods.

  In general, `track()` should be called inside `get()`, and `trigger()` should be called inside `set()`. However, you have full control over when they should be called, or whether they should be called at all.

- **Example**

  Creating a debounced ref that only updates the value after a certain timeout after the latest set call:

  ```js
  import { customRef } from 'vue'

  export function useDebouncedRef(value, delay = 200) {
    let timeout
    return customRef((track, trigger) => {
      return {
        get() {
          track()
          return value
        },
        set(newValue) {
          clearTimeout(timeout)
          timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            value = newValue
            trigger()
          }, delay)
        }
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  Usage in component:

  ```vue
  <script setup>
  import { useDebouncedRef } from './debouncedRef'
  const text = useDebouncedRef('hello')
  </script>

  <template>
    <input v-model="text" />
  </template>
  ```

  :::warning Use with caution
  When using customRef, we should be cautious about the return value of its getter, particularly when generating new object datatypes each time the getter is run. This affects the relationship between parent and child components, where such a customRef has been passed as a prop.

  The parent component's render function could be triggered by changes to a different reactive state. During rerender, the value of our customRef is reevaluated, returning a new object datatype as a prop to a child component. This prop is compared with its last value in the child component, and since they are different, the reactive dependencies of the customRef are triggered in the child component. Meanwhile, the reactive dependencies in the parent component do not run because the customRef's setter was not called, and its dependencies were not triggered as a result.

  :::

## shallowReactive() {#shallowreactive}

Shallow version of [`reactive()`](./reactivity-core#reactive).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function shallowReactive<T extends object>(target: T): T
  ```

- **Details**

  Unlike `reactive()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are reactive for a shallow reactive object. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.

  :::warning Use with Caution
  Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.
  :::

- **Example**

  ```js
  const state = shallowReactive({
    foo: 1,
    nested: {
      bar: 2
    }
  })

  // mutating state's own properties is reactive
  state.foo++

  // ...but does not convert nested objects
  isReactive(state.nested) // false

  // NOT reactive
  state.nested.bar++
  ```

## shallowReadonly() {#shallowreadonly}

Shallow version of [`readonly()`](./reactivity-core#readonly).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function shallowReadonly<T extends object>(target: T): Readonly<T>
  ```

- **Details**

  Unlike `readonly()`, there is no deep conversion: only root-level properties are made readonly. Property values are stored and exposed as-is - this also means properties with ref values will **not** be automatically unwrapped.

  :::warning Use with Caution
  Shallow data structures should only be used for root level state in a component. Avoid nesting it inside a deep reactive object as it creates a tree with inconsistent reactivity behavior which can be difficult to understand and debug.
  :::

- **Example**

  ```js
  const state = shallowReadonly({
    foo: 1,
    nested: {
      bar: 2
    }
  })

  // mutating state's own properties will fail
  state.foo++

  // ...but works on nested objects
  isReadonly(state.nested) // false

  // works
  state.nested.bar++
  ```

## toRaw() {#toraw}

Returns the raw, original object of a Vue-created proxy.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function toRaw<T>(proxy: T): T
  ```

- **Details**

  `toRaw()` can return the original object from proxies created by [`reactive()`](./reactivity-core#reactive), [`readonly()`](./reactivity-core#readonly), [`shallowReactive()`](#shallowreactive) or [`shallowReadonly()`](#shallowreadonly).

  This is an escape hatch that can be used to temporarily read without incurring proxy access / tracking overhead or write without triggering changes. It is **not** recommended to hold a persistent reference to the original object. Use with caution.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const foo = {}
  const reactiveFoo = reactive(foo)

  console.log(toRaw(reactiveFoo) === foo) // true
  ```

## markRaw() {#markraw}

Marks an object so that it will never be converted to a proxy. Returns the object itself.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function markRaw<T extends object>(value: T): T
  ```

- **Example**

  ```js
  const foo = markRaw({})
  console.log(isReactive(reactive(foo))) // false

  // also works when nested inside other reactive objects
  const bar = reactive({ foo })
  console.log(isReactive(bar.foo)) // false
  ```

  :::warning Use with Caution
  `markRaw()` and shallow APIs such as `shallowReactive()` allow you to selectively opt-out of the default deep reactive/readonly conversion and embed raw, non-proxied objects in your state graph. They can be used for various reasons:

  - Some values simply should not be made reactive, for example a complex 3rd party class instance, or a Vue component object.

  - Skipping proxy conversion can provide performance improvements when rendering large lists with immutable data sources.

  They are considered advanced because the raw opt-out is only at the root level, so if you set a nested, non-marked raw object into a reactive object and then access it again, you get the proxied version back. This can lead to **identity hazards** - i.e. performing an operation that relies on object identity but using both the raw and the proxied version of the same object:

  ```js
  const foo = markRaw({
    nested: {}
  })

  const bar = reactive({
    // although `foo` is marked as raw, foo.nested is not.
    nested: foo.nested
  })

  console.log(foo.nested === bar.nested) // false
  ```

  Identity hazards are in general rare. However, to properly utilize these APIs while safely avoiding identity hazards requires a solid understanding of how the reactivity system works.

  :::

## effectScope() {#effectscope}

Creates an effect scope object which can capture the reactive effects (i.e. computed and watchers) created within it so that these effects can be disposed together. For detailed use cases of this API, please consult its corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0041-reactivity-effect-scope.md).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function effectScope(detached?: boolean): EffectScope

  interface EffectScope {
    run<T>(fn: () => T): T | undefined // undefined if scope is inactive
    stop(): void
  }
  ```

- **Example**

  ```js
  const scope = effectScope()

  scope.run(() => {
    const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)

    watch(doubled, () => console.log(doubled.value))

    watchEffect(() => console.log('Count: ', doubled.value))
  })

  // to dispose all effects in the scope
  scope.stop()
  ```

## getCurrentScope() {#getcurrentscope}

Returns the current active [effect scope](#effectscope) if there is one.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function getCurrentScope(): EffectScope | undefined
  ```

## onScopeDispose() {#onscopedispose}

Registers a dispose callback on the current active [effect scope](#effectscope). The callback will be invoked when the associated effect scope is stopped.

This method can be used as a non-component-coupled replacement of `onUnmounted` in reusable composition functions, since each Vue component's `setup()` function is also invoked in an effect scope.

A warning will be thrown if this function is called without an active effect scope. In 3.5+, this warning can be suppressed by passing `true` as the second argument.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function onScopeDispose(fn: () => void, failSilently?: boolean): void
  ```

To better understand the Reactivity APIs, it is recommended to read the following chapters in the guide:

- [Reactivity Fundamentals](/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) (with the API preference set to Composition API)
- [Reactivity in Depth](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth)
  :::

## ref() {#ref}

Takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object, which has a single property `.value` that points to the inner value.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function ref<T>(value: T): Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>

  interface Ref<T> {
    value: T
  }
  ```

- **Details**

  The ref object is mutable - i.e. you can assign new values to `.value`. It is also reactive - i.e. any read operations to `.value` are tracked, and write operations will trigger associated effects.

  If an object is assigned as a ref's value, the object is made deeply reactive with [reactive()](#reactive). This also means if the object contains nested refs, they will be deeply unwrapped.

  To avoid the deep conversion, use [`shallowRef()`](./reactivity-advanced#shallowref) instead.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const count = ref(0)
  console.log(count.value) // 0

  count.value = 1
  console.log(count.value) // 1
  ```

  - [Guide - Typing `ref()`](/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-ref) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

## computed() {#computed}

Takes a [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get#description) and returns a readonly reactive [ref](#ref) object for the returned value from the getter. It can also take an object with `get` and `set` functions to create a writable ref object.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  // read-only
  function computed<T>(
    getter: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T,
    // see "Computed Debugging" link below
    debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions
  ): Readonly<Ref<Readonly<T>>>

  // writable
  function computed<T>(
    options: {
      get: (oldValue: T | undefined) => T
      set: (value: T) => void
    },
    debuggerOptions?: DebuggerOptions
  ): Ref<T>
  ```

- **Example**

  Creating a readonly computed ref:

  ```js
  const count = ref(1)
  const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1)

  console.log(plusOne.value) // 2

  plusOne.value++ // error
  ```

  Creating a writable computed ref:

  ```js
  const count = ref(1)
  const plusOne = computed({
    get: () => count.value + 1,
    set: (val) => {
      count.value = val - 1
    }
  })

  plusOne.value = 1
  console.log(count.value) // 0
  ```

  Debugging:

  ```js
  const plusOne = computed(() => count.value + 1, {
    onTrack(e) {
      debugger
    },
    onTrigger(e) {
      debugger
    }
  })
  ```

  - [Guide - Performance - Computed Stability](/guide/best-practices/performance#computed-stability)

## reactive() {#reactive}

Returns a reactive proxy of the object.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function reactive<T extends object>(target: T): UnwrapNestedRefs<T>
  ```

- **Details**

  The reactive conversion is "deep": it affects all nested properties. A reactive object also deeply unwraps any properties that are [refs](#ref) while maintaining reactivity.

  It should also be noted that there is no ref unwrapping performed when the ref is accessed as an element of a reactive array or a native collection type like `Map`.

  To avoid the deep conversion and only retain reactivity at the root level, use [shallowReactive()](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) instead.

  The returned object and its nested objects are wrapped with [ES Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and **not** equal to the original objects. It is recommended to work exclusively with the reactive proxy and avoid relying on the original object.

- **Example**

  Creating a reactive object:

  ```js
  const obj = reactive({ count: 0 })
  obj.count++
  ```

  Ref unwrapping:

  ```ts
  const count = ref(1)
  const obj = reactive({ count })

  // ref will be unwrapped
  console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true

  // it will update `obj.count`
  count.value++
  console.log(count.value) // 2
  console.log(obj.count) // 2

  // it will also update `count` ref
  obj.count++
  console.log(obj.count) // 3
  console.log(count.value) // 3
  ```

  Note that refs are **not** unwrapped when accessed as array or collection elements:

  ```js
  const books = reactive([ref('Vue 3 Guide')])
  // need .value here
  console.log(books[0].value)

  const map = reactive(new Map([['count', ref(0)]]))
  // need .value here
  console.log(map.get('count').value)
  ```

  When assigning a [ref](#ref) to a `reactive` property, that ref will also be automatically unwrapped:

  ```ts
  const count = ref(1)
  const obj = reactive({})

  obj.count = count

  console.log(obj.count) // 1
  console.log(obj.count === count.value) // true
  ```

- **See also**
  - [Guide - Reactivity Fundamentals](/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals)
  - [Guide - Typing `reactive()`](/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

## readonly() {#readonly}

Takes an object (reactive or plain) or a [ref](#ref) and returns a readonly proxy to the original.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function readonly<T extends object>(
    target: T
  ): DeepReadonly<UnwrapNestedRefs<T>>
  ```

- **Details**

  A readonly proxy is deep: any nested property accessed will be readonly as well. It also has the same ref-unwrapping behavior as `reactive()`, except the unwrapped values will also be made readonly.

  To avoid the deep conversion, use [shallowReadonly()](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly) instead.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const original = reactive({ count: 0 })

  const copy = readonly(original)

  watchEffect(() => {
    // works for reactivity tracking
    console.log(copy.count)
  })

  // mutating original will trigger watchers relying on the copy
  original.count++

  // mutating the copy will fail and result in a warning
  copy.count++ // warning!
  ```

## watchEffect() {#watcheffect}

Runs a function immediately while reactively tracking its dependencies and re-runs it whenever the dependencies are changed.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function watchEffect(
    effect: (onCleanup: OnCleanup) => void,
    options?: WatchEffectOptions
  ): WatchHandle

  type OnCleanup = (cleanupFn: () => void) => void

  interface WatchEffectOptions {
    flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'
    onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
    onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
  }

  interface WatchHandle {
    (): void // callable, same as `stop`
    pause: () => void
    resume: () => void
    stop: () => void
  }
  ```

- **Details**

  The first argument is the effect function to be run. The effect function receives a function that can be used to register a cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request (see example below).

  The second argument is an optional options object that can be used to adjust the effect's flush timing or to debug the effect's dependencies.

  By default, watchers will run just prior to component rendering. Setting `flush: 'post'` will defer the watcher until after component rendering. See [Callback Flush Timing](/guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) for more information. In rare cases, it might be necessary to trigger a watcher immediately when a reactive dependency changes, e.g. to invalidate a cache. This can be achieved using `flush: 'sync'`. However, this setting should be used with caution, as it can lead to problems with performance and data consistency if multiple properties are being updated at the same time.

  The return value is a handle function that can be called to stop the effect from running again.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const count = ref(0)

  watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))
  // -> logs 0

  count.value++
  // -> logs 1
  ```

  Stopping the watcher:

  ```js
  const stop = watchEffect(() => {})

  // when the watcher is no longer needed:
  stop()
  ```

  Pausing / resuming the watcher: <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" />

  ```js
  const { stop, pause, resume } = watchEffect(() => {})

  // temporarily pause the watcher
  pause()

  // resume later
  resume()

  // stop
  stop()
  ```

  Side effect cleanup:

  ```js
  watchEffect(async (onCleanup) => {
    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)
    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling
    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet
    onCleanup(cancel)
    data.value = await response
  })
  ```

  Side effect cleanup in 3.5+:

  ```js
  import { onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

  watchEffect(async () => {
    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)
    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling
    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet
    onWatcherCleanup(cancel)
    data.value = await response
  })
  ```

  Options:

  ```js
  watchEffect(() => {}, {
    flush: 'post',
    onTrack(e) {
      debugger
    },
    onTrigger(e) {
      debugger
    }
  })
  ```

## watch() {#watch}

Watches one or more reactive data sources and invokes a callback function when the sources change.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  // watching single source
  function watch<T>(
    source: WatchSource<T>,
    callback: WatchCallback<T>,
    options?: WatchOptions
  ): WatchHandle

  // watching multiple sources
  function watch<T>(
    sources: WatchSource<T>[],
    callback: WatchCallback<T[]>,
    options?: WatchOptions
  ): WatchHandle

  type WatchCallback<T> = (
    value: T,
    oldValue: T,
    onCleanup: (cleanupFn: () => void) => void
  ) => void

  type WatchSource<T> =
    | Ref<T> // ref
    | (() => T) // getter
    | (T extends object ? T : never) // reactive object

  interface WatchOptions extends WatchEffectOptions {
    immediate?: boolean // default: false
    deep?: boolean | number // default: false
    flush?: 'pre' | 'post' | 'sync' // default: 'pre'
    onTrack?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
    onTrigger?: (event: DebuggerEvent) => void
    once?: boolean // default: false (3.4+)
  }

  interface WatchHandle {
    (): void // callable, same as `stop`
    pause: () => void
    resume: () => void
    stop: () => void
  }
  ```

  > Types are simplified for readability.

- **Details**

  `watch()` is lazy by default - i.e. the callback is only called when the watched source has changed.

  The first argument is the watcher's **source**. The source can be one of the following:

  - A getter function that returns a value
  - A ref
  - A reactive object
  - ...or an array of the above.

  The second argument is the callback that will be called when the source changes. The callback receives three arguments: the new value, the old value, and a function for registering a side effect cleanup callback. The cleanup callback will be called right before the next time the effect is re-run, and can be used to clean up invalidated side effects, e.g. a pending async request.

  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives two arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array.

  The third optional argument is an options object that supports the following options:

  - **`immediate`**: trigger the callback immediately on watcher creation. Old value will be `undefined` on the first call.
  - **`deep`**: force deep traversal of the source if it is an object, so that the callback fires on deep mutations. In 3.5+, this can also be a number indicating the max traversal depth. See [Deep Watchers](/guide/essentials/watchers#deep-watchers).
  - **`flush`**: adjust the callback's flush timing. See [Callback Flush Timing](/guide/essentials/watchers#callback-flush-timing) and [`watchEffect()`](/api/reactivity-core#watcheffect).
  - **`onTrack / onTrigger`**: debug the watcher's dependencies. See [Watcher Debugging](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging).
  - **`once`**: (3.4+) run the callback only once. The watcher is automatically stopped after the first callback run.

  Compared to [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect), `watch()` allows us to:

  - Perform the side effect lazily;
  - Be more specific about what state should trigger the watcher to re-run;
  - Access both the previous and current value of the watched state.

- **Example**

  Watching a getter:

  ```js
  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
  watch(
    () => state.count,
    (count, prevCount) => {
      /* ... */
    }
  )
  ```

  Watching a ref:

  ```js
  const count = ref(0)
  watch(count, (count, prevCount) => {
    /* ... */
  })
  ```

  When watching multiple sources, the callback receives arrays containing new / old values corresponding to the source array:

  ```js
  watch([fooRef, barRef], ([foo, bar], [prevFoo, prevBar]) => {
    /* ... */
  })
  ```

  When using a getter source, the watcher only fires if the getter's return value has changed. If you want the callback to fire even on deep mutations, you need to explicitly force the watcher into deep mode with `{ deep: true }`. Note in deep mode, the new value and the old will be the same object if the callback was triggered by a deep mutation:

  ```js
  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
  watch(
    () => state,
    (newValue, oldValue) => {
      // newValue === oldValue
    },
    { deep: true }
  )
  ```

  When directly watching a reactive object, the watcher is automatically in deep mode:

  ```js
  const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
  watch(state, () => {
    /* triggers on deep mutation to state */
  })
  ```

  `watch()` shares the same flush timing and debugging options with [`watchEffect()`](#watcheffect):

  ```js
  watch(source, callback, {
    flush: 'post',
    onTrack(e) {
      debugger
    },
    onTrigger(e) {
      debugger
    }
  })
  ```

  Stopping the watcher:

  ```js
  const stop = watch(source, callback)

  // when the watcher is no longer needed:
  stop()
  ```

  Pausing / resuming the watcher: <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" />

  ```js
  const { stop, pause, resume } = watch(() => {})

  // temporarily pause the watcher
  pause()

  // resume later
  resume()

  // stop
  stop()
  ```

  Side effect cleanup:

  ```js
  watch(id, async (newId, oldId, onCleanup) => {
    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)
    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling
    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet
    onCleanup(cancel)
    data.value = await response
  })
  ```

  Side effect cleanup in 3.5+:

  ```js
  import { onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

  watch(id, async (newId) => {
    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)
    onWatcherCleanup(cancel)
    data.value = await response
  })
  ```

  - [Guide - Watcher Debugging](/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth#watcher-debugging)

## onWatcherCleanup() <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> {#onwatchercleanup}

Register a cleanup function to be executed when the current watcher is about to re-run. Can only be called during the synchronous execution of a `watchEffect` effect function or `watch` callback function (i.e. it cannot be called after an `await` statement in an async function.)

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function onWatcherCleanup(
    cleanupFn: () => void,
    failSilently?: boolean
  ): void
  ```

- **Example**

  ```ts
  import { watch, onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

  watch(id, (newId) => {
    const { response, cancel } = doAsyncWork(newId)
    // `cancel` will be called if `id` changes, cancelling
    // the previous request if it hasn't completed yet
    onWatcherCleanup(cancel)
  })
  ```

## isRef() {#isref}

Checks if a value is a ref object.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function isRef<T>(r: Ref<T> | unknown): r is Ref<T>
  ```

  Note the return type is a [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates), which means `isRef` can be used as a type guard:

  ```ts
  let foo: unknown
  if (isRef(foo)) {
    // foo's type is narrowed to Ref<unknown>
    foo.value
  }
  ```

## unref() {#unref}

Returns the inner value if the argument is a ref, otherwise return the argument itself. This is a sugar function for `val = isRef(val) ? val.value : val`.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function unref<T>(ref: T | Ref<T>): T
  ```

- **Example**

  ```ts
  function useFoo(x: number | Ref<number>) {
    const unwrapped = unref(x)
    // unwrapped is guaranteed to be number now
  }
  ```

## toRef() {#toref}

Can be used to normalize values / refs / getters into refs (3.3+).

Can also be used to create a ref for a property on a source reactive object. The created ref is synced with its source property: mutating the source property will update the ref, and vice-versa.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  // normalization signature (3.3+)
  function toRef<T>(
    value: T
  ): T extends () => infer R
    ? Readonly<Ref<R>>
    : T extends Ref
    ? T
    : Ref<UnwrapRef<T>>

  // object property signature
  function toRef<T extends object, K extends keyof T>(
    object: T,
    key: K,
    defaultValue?: T[K]
  ): ToRef<T[K]>

  type ToRef<T> = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>
  ```

- **Example**

  Normalization signature (3.3+):

  ```js
  // returns existing refs as-is
  toRef(existingRef)

  // creates a readonly ref that calls the getter on .value access
  toRef(() => props.foo)

  // creates normal refs from non-function values
  // equivalent to ref(1)
  toRef(1)
  ```

  Object property signature:

  ```js
  const state = reactive({
    foo: 1,
    bar: 2
  })

  // a two-way ref that syncs with the original property
  const fooRef = toRef(state, 'foo')

  // mutating the ref updates the original
  fooRef.value++
  console.log(state.foo) // 2

  // mutating the original also updates the ref
  state.foo++
  console.log(fooRef.value) // 3
  ```

  Note this is different from:

  ```js
  const fooRef = ref(state.foo)
  ```

  The above ref is **not** synced with `state.foo`, because the `ref()` receives a plain number value.

  `toRef()` is useful when you want to pass the ref of a prop to a composable function:

  ```vue
  <script setup>
  import { toRef } from 'vue'

  const props = defineProps(/* ... */)

  // convert `props.foo` into a ref, then pass into
  // a composable
  useSomeFeature(toRef(props, 'foo'))

  // getter syntax - recommended in 3.3+
  useSomeFeature(toRef(() => props.foo))
  </script>
  ```

  When `toRef` is used with component props, the usual restrictions around mutating the props still apply. Attempting to assign a new value to the ref is equivalent to trying to modify the prop directly and is not allowed. In that scenario you may want to consider using [`computed`](./reactivity-core#computed) with `get` and `set` instead. See the guide to [using `v-model` with components](/guide/components/v-model) for more information.

  When using the object property signature, `toRef()` will return a usable ref even if the source property doesn't currently exist. This makes it possible to work with optional properties, which wouldn't be picked up by [`toRefs`](#torefs).

## toValue() {#tovalue}

- Only supported in 3.3+

Normalizes values / refs / getters to values. This is similar to [unref()](#unref), except that it also normalizes getters. If the argument is a getter, it will be invoked and its return value will be returned.

This can be used in [Composables](/guide/reusability/composables.html) to normalize an argument that can be either a value, a ref, or a getter.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function toValue<T>(source: T | Ref<T> | (() => T)): T
  ```

- **Example**

  ```js
  toValue(1) //       --> 1
  toValue(ref(1)) //  --> 1
  toValue(() => 1) // --> 1
  ```

  Normalizing arguments in composables:

  ```ts
  import type { MaybeRefOrGetter } from 'vue'

  function useFeature(id: MaybeRefOrGetter<number>) {
    watch(() => toValue(id), id => {
      // react to id changes
    })
  }

  // this composable supports any of the following:
  useFeature(1)
  useFeature(ref(1))
  useFeature(() => 1)
  ```

## toRefs() {#torefs}

Converts a reactive object to a plain object where each property of the resulting object is a ref pointing to the corresponding property of the original object. Each individual ref is created using [`toRef()`](#toref).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function toRefs<T extends object>(
    object: T
  ): {
    [K in keyof T]: ToRef<T[K]>
  }

  type ToRef = T extends Ref ? T : Ref<T>
  ```

- **Example**

  ```js
  const state = reactive({
    foo: 1,
    bar: 2
  })

  const stateAsRefs = toRefs(state)
  /*
  Type of stateAsRefs: {
    foo: Ref<number>,
    bar: Ref<number>
  }
  */

  // The ref and the original property is "linked"
  state.foo++
  console.log(stateAsRefs.foo.value) // 2

  stateAsRefs.foo.value++
  console.log(state.foo) // 3
  ```

  `toRefs` is useful when returning a reactive object from a composable function so that the consuming component can destructure/spread the returned object without losing reactivity:

  ```js
  function useFeatureX() {
    const state = reactive({
      foo: 1,
      bar: 2
    })

    // ...logic operating on state

    // convert to refs when returning
    return toRefs(state)
  }

  // can destructure without losing reactivity
  const { foo, bar } = useFeatureX()
  ```

  `toRefs` will only generate refs for properties that are enumerable on the source object at call time. To create a ref for a property that may not exist yet, use [`toRef`](#toref) instead.

## isProxy() {#isproxy}

Checks if an object is a proxy created by [`reactive()`](./reactivity-core#reactive), [`readonly()`](./reactivity-core#readonly), [`shallowReactive()`](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) or [`shallowReadonly()`](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function isProxy(value: any): boolean
  ```

## isReactive() {#isreactive}

Checks if an object is a proxy created by [`reactive()`](./reactivity-core#reactive) or [`shallowReactive()`](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive).

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function isReactive(value: unknown): boolean
  ```

## isReadonly() {#isreadonly}

Checks whether the passed value is a readonly object. The properties of a readonly object can change, but they can't be assigned directly via the passed object.

The proxies created by [`readonly()`](./reactivity-core#readonly) and [`shallowReadonly()`](./reactivity-advanced#shallowreadonly) are both considered readonly, as is a [`computed()`](./reactivity-core#computed) ref without a `set` function.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  function isReadonly(value: unknown): boolean
  ```

## Declaring Reactive State \* {#declaring-reactive-state}

With the Options API, we use the `data` option to declare reactive state of a component. The option value should be a function that returns an object. Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):

```js{2-6}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  },

  // `mounted` is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later
  mounted() {
    // `this` refers to the component instance.
    console.log(this.count) // => 1

    // data can be mutated as well
    this.count = 2
  }
}
```

[Try it in the Playground](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNpFUNFqhDAQ/JXBpzsoHu2j3B2U/oYPpnGtoetGkrW2iP/eRFsPApthd2Zndilex7H8mqioimu0wY16r4W+Rx8ULXVmYsVSC9AaNafz/gcC6RTkHwHWT6IVnne85rI+1ZLr5YJmyG1qG7gIA3Yd2R/LhN77T8y9sz1mwuyYkXazcQI2SiHz/7iP3VlQexeb5KKjEKEe2lPyMIxeSBROohqxVO4E6yV6ppL9xykTy83tOQvd7tnzoZtDwhrBO2GYNFloYWLyxrzPPOi44WWLWUt618txvASUhhRCKSHgbZt2scKy7HfCujGOqWL9BVfOgyI=)

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

It is possible to add a new property directly to `this` without including it in `data`. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.

Vue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.
