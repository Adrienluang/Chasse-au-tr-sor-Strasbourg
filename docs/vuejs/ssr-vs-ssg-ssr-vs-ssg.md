### SSR vs. SSG {#ssr-vs-ssg}

**Static Site Generation (SSG)**, also referred to as pre-rendering, is another popular technique for building fast websites. If the data needed to server-render a page is the same for every user, then instead of rendering the page every time a request comes in, we can render it only once, ahead of time, during the build process. Pre-rendered pages are generated and served as static HTML files.

SSG retains the same performance characteristics of SSR apps: it provides great time-to-content performance. At the same time, it is cheaper and easier to deploy than SSR apps because the output is static HTML and assets. The keyword here is **static**: SSG can only be applied to pages providing static data, i.e. data that is known at build time and can not change between requests. Every time the data changes, a new deployment is needed.

If you're only investigating SSR to improve the SEO of a handful of marketing pages (e.g. `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, etc.), then you probably want SSG instead of SSR. SSG is also great for content-based websites such as documentation sites or blogs. In fact, this website you are reading right now is statically generated using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a Vue-powered static site generator.
