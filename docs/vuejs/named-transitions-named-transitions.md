### Named Transitions {#named-transitions}

A transition can be named via the `name` prop:

```vue-html
<Transition name="fade">
  ...
</Transition>
```

For a named transition, its transition classes will be prefixed with its name instead of `v`. For example, the applied class for the above transition will be `fade-enter-active` instead of `v-enter-active`. The CSS for the fade transition should look like this:

```css
.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;
}

.fade-enter-from,
.fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}
```
