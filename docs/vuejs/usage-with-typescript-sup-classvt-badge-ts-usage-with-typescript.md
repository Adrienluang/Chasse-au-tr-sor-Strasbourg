### Usage with TypeScript <sup class="vt-badge ts" /> {#usage-with-typescript}

Like `defineProps` and `defineEmits`, `defineModel` can also receive type arguments to specify the types of the model value and the modifiers:

```ts
const modelValue = defineModel<string>()
//    ^? Ref<string | undefined>

// default model with options, required removes possible undefined values
const modelValue = defineModel<string>({ required: true })
//    ^? Ref<string>

const [modelValue, modifiers] = defineModel<string, 'trim' | 'uppercase'>()
//                 ^? Record<'trim' | 'uppercase', true | undefined>
```

## defineExpose() {#defineexpose}

Components using `<script setup>` are **closed by default** - i.e. the public instance of the component, which is retrieved via template refs or `$parent` chains, will **not** expose any of the bindings declared inside `<script setup>`.

To explicitly expose properties in a `<script setup>` component, use the `defineExpose` compiler macro:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const a = 1
const b = ref(2)

defineExpose({
  a,
  b
})
</script>
```

When a parent gets an instance of this component via template refs, the retrieved instance will be of the shape `{ a: number, b: number }` (refs are automatically unwrapped just like on normal instances).

## defineOptions() {#defineoptions}

- Only supported in 3.3+

This macro can be used to declare component options directly inside `<script setup>` without having to use a separate `<script>` block:

```vue
<script setup>
defineOptions({
  inheritAttrs: false,
  customOptions: {
    /* ... */
  }
})
</script>
```

- This is a macro. The options will be hoisted to module scope and cannot access local variables in `<script setup>` that are not literal constants.

## defineSlots()<sup class="vt-badge ts"/> {#defineslots}

- Only supported in 3.3+

This macro can be used to provide type hints to IDEs for slot name and props type checking.

`defineSlots()` only accepts a type parameter and no runtime arguments. The type parameter should be a type literal where the property key is the slot name, and the value type is the slot function. The first argument of the function is the props the slot expects to receive, and its type will be used for slot props in the template. The return type is currently ignored and can be `any`, but we may leverage it for slot content checking in the future.

It also returns the `slots` object, which is equivalent to the `slots` object exposed on the setup context or returned by `useSlots()`.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const slots = defineSlots<{
  default(props: { msg: string }): any
}>()
</script>
```

## `useSlots()` & `useAttrs()` {#useslots-useattrs}

Usage of `slots` and `attrs` inside `<script setup>` should be relatively rare, since you can access them directly as `$slots` and `$attrs` in the template. In the rare case where you do need them, use the `useSlots` and `useAttrs` helpers respectively:

```vue
<script setup>
import { useSlots, useAttrs } from 'vue'

const slots = useSlots()
const attrs = useAttrs()
</script>
```

`useSlots` and `useAttrs` are actual runtime functions that return the equivalent of `setupContext.slots` and `setupContext.attrs`. They can be used in normal composition API functions as well.

## Usage alongside normal `<script>` {#usage-alongside-normal-script}

`<script setup>` can be used alongside normal `<script>`. A normal `<script>` may be needed in cases where we need to:

- Declare options that cannot be expressed in `<script setup>`, for example `inheritAttrs` or custom options enabled via plugins (Can be replaced by [`defineOptions`](/api/sfc-script-setup#defineoptions) in 3.3+).
- Declaring named exports.
- Run side effects or create objects that should only execute once.

```vue
<script>
// normal <script>, executed in module scope (only once)
runSideEffectOnce()

// declare additional options
export default {
  inheritAttrs: false,
  customOptions: {}
}
</script>

<script setup>
// executed in setup() scope (for each instance)
</script>
```

Support for combining `<script setup>` and `<script>` in the same component is limited to the scenarios described above. Specifically:

- Do **NOT** use a separate `<script>` section for options that can already be defined using `<script setup>`, such as `props` and `emits`.
- Variables created inside `<script setup>` are not added as properties to the component instance, making them inaccessible from the Options API. Mixing APIs in this way is strongly discouraged.

If you find yourself in one of the scenarios that is not supported then you should consider switching to an explicit [`setup()`](/api/composition-api-setup) function, instead of using `<script setup>`.

## Top-level `await` {#top-level-await}

Top-level `await` can be used inside `<script setup>`. The resulting code will be compiled as `async setup()`:

```vue
<script setup>
const post = await fetch(`/api/post/1`).then((r) => r.json())
</script>
```

In addition, the awaited expression will be automatically compiled in a format that preserves the current component instance context after the `await`.

:::warning Note
`async setup()` must be used in combination with [`Suspense`](/guide/built-ins/suspense.html), which is currently still an experimental feature. We plan to finalize and document it in a future release - but if you are curious now, you can refer to its [tests](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/packages/runtime-core/__tests__/components/Suspense.spec.ts) to see how it works.
:::

## Import Statements {#imports-statements}

Import statements in vue follow [ECMAScript module specification](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).
In addition, you can use aliases defined in your build tool configuration:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { componentA } from './Components'
import { componentB } from '@/Components'
import { componentC } from '~/Components'
</script>
```

## Generics <sup class="vt-badge ts" /> {#generics}

Generic type parameters can be declared using the `generic` attribute on the `<script>` tag:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T">
defineProps<{
  items: T[]
  selected: T
}>()
</script>
```

The value of `generic` works exactly the same as the parameter list between `<...>` in TypeScript. For example, you can use multiple parameters, `extends` constraints, default types, and reference imported types:

```vue
<script
  setup
  lang="ts"
  generic="T extends string | number, U extends Item"
>
import type { Item } from './types'
defineProps<{
  id: T
  list: U[]
}>()
</script>
```

You can use `@vue-generic` the directive to pass in explicit types, for when the type cannot be inferred:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- @vue-generic {import('@/api').Actor} -->
  <ApiSelect v-model="peopleIds" endpoint="/api/actors" id-prop="actorId" />

  <!-- @vue-generic {import('@/api').Genre} -->
  <ApiSelect v-model="genreIds" endpoint="/api/genres" id-prop="genreId" />
</template>
```

In order to use a reference to a generic component in a `ref` you need to use the [`vue-component-type-helpers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-component-type-helpers) library as `InstanceType` won't work.

```vue
<script
  setup
  lang="ts"
>
import componentWithoutGenerics from '../component-without-generics.vue';
import genericComponent from '../generic-component.vue';

import type { ComponentExposed } from 'vue-component-type-helpers';

// Works for a component without generics
ref<InstanceType<typeof componentWithoutGenerics>>();

ref<ComponentExposed<typeof genericComponent>>();
```

## Restrictions {#restrictions}

- Due to the difference in module execution semantics, code inside `<script setup>` relies on the context of an SFC. When moved into external `.js` or `.ts` files, it may lead to confusion for both developers and tools. Therefore, **`<script setup>`** cannot be used with the `src` attribute.
- `<script setup>` does not support In-DOM Root Component Template.([Related Discussion](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/8391))

# Accessibility {#accessibility}

Web accessibility (also known as a11y) refers to the practice of creating websites that can be used by anyone — be that a person with a disability, a slow connection, outdated or broken hardware or simply someone in an unfavorable environment. For example, adding subtitles to a video would help both your deaf and hard-of-hearing users and your users who are in a loud environment and can't hear their phone. Similarly, making sure your text isn't too low contrast will help both your low-vision users and your users who are trying to use their phone in bright sunlight.

Ready to start but aren’t sure where?

Checkout the [Planning and managing web accessibility guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/) provided by [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/)

## Skip link {#skip-link}

You should add a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area so users can skip content that is repeated on multiple Web pages.

Typically this is done on the top of `App.vue` as it will be the first focusable element on all your pages:

```vue-html
<span ref="backToTop" tabindex="-1" />
<ul class="skip-links">
  <li>
    <a href="#main" ref="skipLink" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

To hide the link unless it is focused, you can add the following style:

```css
.skip-links {
  list-style: none;
}
.skip-link {
  white-space: nowrap;
  margin: 1em auto;
  top: 0;
  position: fixed;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -72px;
  opacity: 0;
}
.skip-link:focus {
  opacity: 1;
  background-color: white;
  padding: 0.5em;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

Once a user changes route, bring focus back to the very beginning of the page, right before the skip link. This can be achieved by calling focus on the `backToTop` template ref (assuming usage of `vue-router`):

<div class="options-api">

```vue
<script>
export default {
  watch: {
    $route() {
      this.$refs.backToTop.focus()
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

</div>
<div class="composition-api">

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router'

const route = useRoute()
const backToTop = ref()

watch(
  () => route.path,
  () => {
    backToTop.value.focus()
  }
)
</script>
```

</div>

## Content Structure {#content-structure}

One of the most important pieces of accessibility is making sure that design can support accessible implementation. Design should consider not only color contrast, font selection, text sizing, and language, but also how the content is structured in the application.
