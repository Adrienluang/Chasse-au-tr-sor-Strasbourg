### Recommendation {#recommendation}

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

  Since the official setup created by `create-vue` is based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/), we recommend using a unit testing framework that can leverage the same configuration and transform pipeline directly from Vite. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a unit testing framework designed specifically for this purpose, created and maintained by Vue / Vite team members. It integrates with Vite-based projects with minimal effort, and is blazing fast.
