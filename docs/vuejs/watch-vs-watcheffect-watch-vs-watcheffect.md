### `watch` vs. `watchEffect` {#watch-vs-watcheffect}

`watch` and `watchEffect` both allow us to reactively perform side effects. Their main difference is the way they track their reactive dependencies:

- `watch` only tracks the explicitly watched source. It won't track anything accessed inside the callback. In addition, the callback only triggers when the source has actually changed. `watch` separates dependency tracking from the side effect, giving us more precise control over when the callback should fire.

- `watchEffect`, on the other hand, combines dependency tracking and side effect into one phase. It automatically tracks every reactive property accessed during its synchronous execution. This is more convenient and typically results in terser code, but makes its reactive dependencies less explicit.

## Side Effect Cleanup {#side-effect-cleanup}

Sometimes we may perform side effects, e.g. asynchronous requests, in a watcher:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
watch(id, (newId) => {
  fetch(`/api/${newId}`).then(() => {
    // callback logic
  })
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  watch: {
    id(newId) {
      fetch(`/api/${newId}`).then(() => {
        // callback logic
      })
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

But what if `id` changes before the request completes? When the previous request completes, it will still fire the callback with an ID value that is already stale. Ideally, we want to be able to cancel the stale request when `id` changes to a new value.

We can use the [`onWatcherCleanup()`](/api/reactivity-core#onwatchercleanup) <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> API to register a cleanup function that will be called when the watcher is invalidated and is about to re-run:

<div class="composition-api">

```js {10-13}
import { watch, onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

watch(id, (newId) => {
  const controller = new AbortController()

  fetch(`/api/${newId}`, { signal: controller.signal }).then(() => {
    // callback logic
  })

  onWatcherCleanup(() => {
    // abort stale request
    controller.abort()
  })
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js {12-15}
import { onWatcherCleanup } from 'vue'

export default {
  watch: {
    id(newId) {
      const controller = new AbortController()

      fetch(`/api/${newId}`, { signal: controller.signal }).then(() => {
        // callback logic
      })

      onWatcherCleanup(() => {
        // abort stale request
        controller.abort()
      })
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

Note that `onWatcherCleanup` is only supported in Vue 3.5+ and must be called during the synchronous execution of a `watchEffect` effect function or `watch` callback function: you cannot call it after an `await` statement in an async function.

Alternatively, an `onCleanup` function is also passed to watcher callbacks as the 3rd argument<span class="composition-api">, and to the `watchEffect` effect function as the first argument</span>:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
watch(id, (newId, oldId, onCleanup) => {
  // ...
  onCleanup(() => {
    // cleanup logic
  })
})

watchEffect((onCleanup) => {
  // ...
  onCleanup(() => {
    // cleanup logic
  })
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  watch: {
    id(newId, oldId, onCleanup) {
      // ...
      onCleanup(() => {
        // cleanup logic
      })
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

This works in versions before 3.5. In addition, `onCleanup` passed via function argument is bound to the watcher instance so it is not subject to the synchronous constraint of `onWatcherCleanup`.

## Callback Flush Timing {#callback-flush-timing}

When you mutate reactive state, it may trigger both Vue component updates and watcher callbacks created by you.

Similar to component updates, user-created watcher callbacks are batched to avoid duplicate invocations. For example, we probably don't want a watcher to fire a thousand times if we synchronously push a thousand items into an array being watched.

By default, a watcher's callback is called **after** parent component updates (if any), and **before** the owner component's DOM updates. This means if you attempt to access the owner component's own DOM inside a watcher callback, the DOM will be in a pre-update state.
