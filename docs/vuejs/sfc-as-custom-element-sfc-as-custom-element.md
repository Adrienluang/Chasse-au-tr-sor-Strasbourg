### SFC as Custom Element {#sfc-as-custom-element}

`defineCustomElement` also works with Vue Single-File Components (SFCs). However, with the default tooling setup, the `<style>` inside the SFCs will still be extracted and merged into a single CSS file during production build. When using an SFC as a custom element, it is often desirable to inject the `<style>` tags into the custom element's shadow root instead.

The official SFC toolings support importing SFCs in "custom element mode" (requires `@vitejs/plugin-vue@^1.4.0` or `vue-loader@^16.5.0`). An SFC loaded in custom element mode inlines its `<style>` tags as strings of CSS and exposes them under the component's `styles` option. This will be picked up by `defineCustomElement` and injected into the element's shadow root when instantiated.

To opt-in to this mode, simply end your component file name with `.ce.vue`:

```js
import { defineCustomElement } from 'vue'
import Example from './Example.ce.vue'

console.log(Example.styles) // ["/* inlined css */"]

// convert into custom element constructor
const ExampleElement = defineCustomElement(Example)

// register
customElements.define('my-example', ExampleElement)
```

If you wish to customize what files should be imported in custom element mode (for example, treating _all_ SFCs as custom elements), you can pass the `customElement` option to the respective build plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#using-vue-sfcs-as-custom-elements)
- [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/tree/next#v16-only-options)
