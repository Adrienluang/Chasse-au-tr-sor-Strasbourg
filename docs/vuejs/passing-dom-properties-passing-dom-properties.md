### Passing DOM Properties {#passing-dom-properties}

Since DOM attributes can only be strings, we need to pass complex data to custom elements as DOM properties. When setting props on a custom element, Vue 3 automatically checks DOM-property presence using the `in` operator and will prefer setting the value as a DOM property if the key is present. This means that, in most cases, you won't need to think about this if the custom element follows the [recommended best practices](https://web.dev/custom-elements-best-practices/).

However, there could be rare cases where the data must be passed as a DOM property, but the custom element does not properly define/reflect the property (causing the `in` check to fail). In this case, you can force a `v-bind` binding to be set as a DOM property using the `.prop` modifier:

```vue-html
<my-element :user.prop="{ name: 'jack' }"></my-element>

<!-- shorthand equivalent -->
<my-element .user="{ name: 'jack' }"></my-element>
```

## Building Custom Elements with Vue {#building-custom-elements-with-vue}

The primary benefit of custom elements is that they can be used with any framework, or even without a framework. This makes them ideal for distributing components where the end consumer may not be using the same frontend stack, or when you want to insulate the end application from the implementation details of the components it uses.
