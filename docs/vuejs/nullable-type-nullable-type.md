### Nullable Type {#nullable-type}

If the type is required but nullable, you can use the array syntax that includes `null`:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
defineProps({
  id: {
    type: [String, null],
    required: true
  }
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  props: {
    id: {
      type: [String, null],
      required: true
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

Note that if `type` is just `null` without using the array syntax, it will allow any type.

## Boolean Casting {#boolean-casting}

Props with `Boolean` type have special casting rules to mimic the behavior of native boolean attributes. Given a `<MyComponent>` with the following declaration:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
defineProps({
  disabled: Boolean
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
export default {
  props: {
    disabled: Boolean
  }
}
```

</div>

The component can be used like this:

```vue-html
<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled="true" -->
<MyComponent disabled />

<!-- equivalent of passing :disabled="false" -->
<MyComponent />
```

When a prop is declared to allow multiple types, the casting rules for `Boolean` will also be applied. However, there is an edge when both `String` and `Boolean` are allowed - the Boolean casting rule only applies if Boolean appears before String:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Boolean, Number]
})

// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Boolean, String]
})

// disabled will be casted to true
defineProps({
  disabled: [Number, Boolean]
})

// disabled will be parsed as an empty string (disabled="")
defineProps({
  disabled: [String, Boolean]
})
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
// disabled will be casted to true
export default {
  props: {
    disabled: [Boolean, Number]
  }
}

// disabled will be casted to true
export default {
  props: {
    disabled: [Boolean, String]
  }
}

// disabled will be casted to true
export default {
  props: {
    disabled: [Number, Boolean]
  }
}

// disabled will be parsed as an empty string (disabled="")
export default {
  props: {
    disabled: [String, Boolean]
  }
}
```

</div>

## Prop Drilling {#prop-drilling}

Usually, when we need to pass data from the parent to a child component, we use [props](/guide/components/props). However, imagine the case where we have a large component tree, and a deeply nested component needs something from a distant ancestor component. With only props, we would have to pass the same prop across the entire parent chain:

![prop drilling diagram](./images/prop-drilling.png)

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/yNDTtReM2xVgjcGVRzChss/prop-drilling -->

Notice although the `<Footer>` component may not care about these props at all, it still needs to declare and pass them along just so `<DeepChild>` can access them. If there is a longer parent chain, more components would be affected along the way. This is called "props drilling" and definitely isn't fun to deal with.

We can solve props drilling with `provide` and `inject`. A parent component can serve as a **dependency provider** for all its descendants. Any component in the descendant tree, regardless of how deep it is, can **inject** dependencies provided by components up in its parent chain.

![Provide/inject scheme](./images/provide-inject.png)

<!-- https://www.figma.com/file/PbTJ9oXis5KUawEOWdy2cE/provide-inject -->

## Provide {#provide}

<div class="composition-api">

To provide data to a component's descendants, use the [`provide()`](/api/composition-api-dependency-injection#provide) function:

```vue
<script setup>
import { provide } from 'vue'

provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
</script>
```

If not using `<script setup>`, make sure `provide()` is called synchronously inside `setup()`:

```js
import { provide } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
  }
}
```

The `provide()` function accepts two arguments. The first argument is called the **injection key**, which can be a string or a `Symbol`. The injection key is used by descendant components to lookup the desired value to inject. A single component can call `provide()` multiple times with different injection keys to provide different values.

The second argument is the provided value. The value can be of any type, including reactive state such as refs:

```js
import { ref, provide } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
provide('key', count)
```

Providing reactive values allows the descendant components using the provided value to establish a reactive connection to the provider component.

</div>

<div class="options-api">

To provide data to a component's descendants, use the [`provide`](/api/options-composition#provide) option:

```js
export default {
  provide: {
    message: 'hello!'
  }
}
```

For each property in the `provide` object, the key is used by child components to locate the correct value to inject, while the value is what ends up being injected.

If we need to provide per-instance state, for example data declared via the `data()`, then `provide` must use a function value:

```js{7-12}
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'hello!'
    }
  },
  provide() {
    // use function syntax so that we can access `this`
    return {
      message: this.message
    }
  }
}
```

However, do note this does **not** make the injection reactive. We will discuss [making injections reactive](#working-with-reactivity) below.

</div>

## App-level Provide {#app-level-provide}

In addition to providing data in a component, we can also provide at the app level:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp({})

app.provide(/* key */ 'message', /* value */ 'hello!')
```

App-level provides are available to all components rendered in the app. This is especially useful when writing [plugins](/guide/reusability/plugins), as plugins typically wouldn't be able to provide values using components.

## Inject {#inject}

<div class="composition-api">

To inject data provided by an ancestor component, use the [`inject()`](/api/composition-api-dependency-injection#inject) function:

```vue
<script setup>
import { inject } from 'vue'

const message = inject('message')
</script>
```

If multiple parents provide data with the same key, inject will resolve to the value from the closest parent in component's parent chain.

If the provided value is a ref, it will be injected as-is and will **not** be automatically unwrapped. This allows the injector component to retain the reactivity connection to the provider component.

[Full provide + inject Example with Reactivity](https://play.vuejs.org/#eNqFUUFugzAQ/MrKF1IpxfeIVKp66Kk/8MWFDXYFtmUbpArx967BhURRU9/WOzO7MzuxV+fKcUB2YlWovXYRAsbBvQije2d9hAk8Xo7gvB11gzDDxdseCuIUG+ZN6a7JjZIvVRIlgDCcw+d3pmvTglz1okJ499I0C3qB1dJQT9YRooVaSdNiACWdQ5OICj2WwtTWhAg9hiBbhHNSOxQKu84WT8LkNQ9FBhTHXyg1K75aJHNUROxdJyNSBVBp44YI43NvG+zOgmWWYGt7dcipqPhGZEe2ef07wN3lltD+lWN6tNkV/37+rdKjK2rzhRTt7f3u41xhe37/xJZGAL2PLECXa9NKdD/a6QTTtGnP88LgiXJtYv4BaLHhvg==)

Again, if not using `<script setup>`, `inject()` should only be called synchronously inside `setup()`:

```js
import { inject } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const message = inject('message')
    return { message }
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="options-api">

To inject data provided by an ancestor component, use the [`inject`](/api/options-composition#inject) option:

```js
export default {
  inject: ['message'],
  created() {
    console.log(this.message) // injected value
  }
}
```

Injections are resolved **before** the component's own state, so you can access injected properties in `data()`:

```js
export default {
  inject: ['message'],
  data() {
    return {
      // initial data based on injected value
      fullMessage: this.message
    }
  }
}
```

If multiple parents provide data with the same key, inject will resolve to the value from the closest parent in component's parent chain.
