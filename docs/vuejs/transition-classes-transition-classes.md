### Transition Classes {#transition-classes}

There are six classes applied for enter / leave transitions.

1. `v-enter-from`: Starting state for enter. Added before the element is inserted, removed one frame after the element is inserted.

2. `v-enter-active`: Active state for enter. Applied during the entire entering phase. Added before the element is inserted, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the entering transition.

3. `v-enter-to`: Ending state for enter. Added one frame after the element is inserted (at the same time `v-enter-from` is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.

4. `v-leave-from`: Starting state for leave. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed after one frame.

5. `v-leave-active`: Active state for leave. Applied during the entire leaving phase. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the leaving transition.

6. `v-leave-to`: Ending state for leave. Added one frame after a leaving transition is triggered (at the same time `v-leave-from` is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.

`v-enter-active` and `v-leave-active` give us the ability to specify different easing curves for enter / leave transitions, which we'll see an example of in the following sections.
