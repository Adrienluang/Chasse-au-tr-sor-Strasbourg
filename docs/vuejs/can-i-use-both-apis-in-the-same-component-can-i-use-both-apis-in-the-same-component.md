### Can I use both APIs in the same component? {#can-i-use-both-apis-in-the-same-component}

Yes. You can use Composition API via the [`setup()`](/api/composition-api-setup) option in an Options API component.

However, we only recommend doing so if you have an existing Options API codebase that needs to integrate with new features / external libraries written with Composition API.
