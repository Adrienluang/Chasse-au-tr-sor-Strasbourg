### Expressions Only {#expressions-only}

Each binding can only contain **one single expression**. An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. A simple check is whether it can be used after `return`.

Therefore, the following will **NOT** work:

```vue-html
<!-- this is a statement, not an expression: -->
{{ var a = 1 }}

<!-- flow control won't work either, use ternary expressions -->
{{ if (ok) { return message } }}
```
