### Recommendation {#recommendation-1}

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for components or composables that render headlessly (e.g. the [`useFavicon`](https://vueuse.org/core/useFavicon/#usefavicon) function in VueUse). Components and DOM can be tested using [`@vue/test-utils`](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils).

- [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component) for components whose expected behavior depends on properly rendering styles or triggering native DOM events. It can be used with Testing Library via [@testing-library/cypress](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro).

The main differences between Vitest and browser-based runners are speed and execution context. In short, browser-based runners, like Cypress, can catch issues that node-based runners, like Vitest, cannot (e.g. style issues, real native DOM events, cookies, local storage, and network failures), but browser-based runners are _orders of magnitude slower than Vitest_ because they do open a browser, compile your stylesheets, and more. Cypress is a browser-based runner that supports component testing. Please read [Vitest's comparison page](https://vitest.dev/guide/comparisons.html#cypress) for the latest information comparing Vitest and Cypress.
