### With Components {#with-components}

> This section assumes knowledge of [Components](/guide/essentials/component-basics). Feel free to skip it and come back later.

When you use the `class` attribute on a component with a single root element, those classes will be added to the component's root element and merged with any existing class already on it.

For example, if we have a component named `MyComponent` with the following template:

```vue-html
<!-- child component template -->
<p class="foo bar">Hi!</p>
```

Then add some classes when using it:

```vue-html
<!-- when using the component -->
<MyComponent class="baz boo" />
```

The rendered HTML will be:

```vue-html
<p class="foo bar baz boo">Hi!</p>
```

The same is true for class bindings:

```vue-html
<MyComponent :class="{ active: isActive }" />
```

When `isActive` is truthy, the rendered HTML will be:

```vue-html
<p class="foo bar active">Hi!</p>
```

If your component has multiple root elements, you would need to define which element will receive this class. You can do this using the `$attrs` component property:

```vue-html
<!-- MyComponent template using $attrs -->
<p :class="$attrs.class">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

```vue-html
<MyComponent class="baz" />
```

Will render:

```html
<p class="baz">Hi!</p>
<span>This is a child component</span>
```

You can learn more about component attribute inheritance in [Fallthrough Attributes](/guide/components/attrs) section.
