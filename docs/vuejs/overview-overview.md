### Overview {#overview}

With a Vite-based setup, the dev server and the bundler are transpilation-only and do not perform any type-checking. This ensures the Vite dev server stays blazing fast even when using TypeScript.

- During development, we recommend relying on a good [IDE setup](#ide-support) for instant feedback on type errors.

- If using SFCs, use the [`vue-tsc`](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) utility for command line type checking and type declaration generation. `vue-tsc` is a wrapper around `tsc`, TypeScript's own command line interface. It works largely the same as `tsc` except that it supports Vue SFCs in addition to TypeScript files. You can run `vue-tsc` in watch mode in parallel to the Vite dev server, or use a Vite plugin like [vite-plugin-checker](https://vite-plugin-checker.netlify.app/) which runs the checks in a separate worker thread.

- Vue CLI also provides TypeScript support, but is no longer recommended. See [notes below](#note-on-vue-cli-and-ts-loader).
