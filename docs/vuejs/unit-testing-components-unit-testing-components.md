### Unit Testing Components {#unit-testing-components}

A component can be tested in two ways:

1. Whitebox: Unit Testing

   Tests that are "Whitebox tests" are aware of the implementation details and dependencies of a component. They are focused on **isolating** the component under test. These tests will usually involve mocking some, if not all of your component's children, as well as setting up plugin state and dependencies (e.g. Pinia).

2. Blackbox: Component Testing

   Tests that are "Blackbox tests" are unaware of the implementation details of a component. These tests mock as little as possible to test the integration of your component and the entire system. They usually render all child components and are considered more of an "integration test". See the [Component Testing recommendations](#component-testing) below.
