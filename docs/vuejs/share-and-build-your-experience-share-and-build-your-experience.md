### Share (and Build) Your Experience {#share-and-build-your-experience}

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.
- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.
