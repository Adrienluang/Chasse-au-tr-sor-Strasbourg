### Top-level bindings are exposed to template {#top-level-bindings-are-exposed-to-template}

When using `<script setup>`, any top-level bindings (including variables, function declarations, and imports) declared inside `<script setup>` are directly usable in the template:

```vue
<script setup>
// variable
const msg = 'Hello!'

// functions
function log() {
  console.log(msg)
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="log">{{ msg }}</button>
</template>
```

Imports are exposed in the same fashion. This means you can directly use an imported helper function in template expressions without having to expose it via the `methods` option:

```vue
<script setup>
import { capitalize } from './helpers'
</script>

<template>
  <div>{{ capitalize('hello') }}</div>
</template>
```

## Reactivity {#reactivity}

Reactive state needs to be explicitly created using [Reactivity APIs](./reactivity-core). Similar to values returned from a `setup()` function, refs are automatically unwrapped when referenced in templates:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">{{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

## Using Components {#using-components}

Values in the scope of `<script setup>` can also be used directly as custom component tag names:

```vue
<script setup>
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'
</script>

<template>
  <MyComponent />
</template>
```

Think of `MyComponent` as being referenced as a variable. If you have used JSX, the mental model is similar here. The kebab-case equivalent `<my-component>` also works in the template - however PascalCase component tags are strongly recommended for consistency. It also helps differentiating from native custom elements.
