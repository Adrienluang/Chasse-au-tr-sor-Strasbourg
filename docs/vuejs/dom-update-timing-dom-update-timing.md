### DOM Update Timing {#dom-update-timing}

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](/api/general#nexttick) global API:

<div class="composition-api">

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

async function increment() {
  count.value++
  await nextTick()
  // Now the DOM is updated
}
```

</div>
<div class="options-api">

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  methods: {
    async increment() {
      this.count++
      await nextTick()
      // Now the DOM is updated
    }
  }
}
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

## `reactive()` \*\* {#reactive}

There is another way to declare reactive state, with the `reactive()` API. Unlike a ref which wraps the inner value in a special object, `reactive()` makes an object itself reactive:

```js
import { reactive } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({ count: 0 })
```

> See also: [Typing Reactive](/guide/typescript/composition-api#typing-reactive) <sup class="vt-badge ts" />

Usage in template:

```vue-html
<button @click="state.count++">
  {{ state.count }}
</button>
```

Reactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to intercept the access and mutation of all properties of a reactive object for reactivity tracking and triggering.

`reactive()` converts the object deeply: nested objects are also wrapped with `reactive()` when accessed. It is also called by `ref()` internally when the ref value is an object. Similar to shallow refs, there is also the [`shallowReactive()`](/api/reactivity-advanced#shallowreactive) API for opting-out of deep reactivity.
