### `v-on` Listener Inheritance {#v-on-listener-inheritance}

The same rule applies to `v-on` event listeners:

```vue-html
<MyButton @click="onClick" />
```

The `click` listener will be added to the root element of `<MyButton>`, i.e. the native `<button>` element. When the native `<button>` is clicked, it will trigger the `onClick` method of the parent component. If the native `<button>` already has a `click` listener bound with `v-on`, then both listeners will trigger.
