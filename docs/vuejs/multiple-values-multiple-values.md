### Multiple Values {#multiple-values}

You can provide an array of multiple (prefixed) values to a style property, for example:

```vue-html
<div :style="{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }"></div>
```

This will only render the last value in the array which the browser supports. In this example, it will render `display: flex` for browsers that support the unprefixed version of flexbox.
