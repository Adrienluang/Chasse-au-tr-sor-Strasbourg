### Modifiers {#modifiers}

Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate that a directive should be bound in some special way. For example, the `.prevent` modifier tells the `v-on` directive to call `event.preventDefault()` on the triggered event:

```vue-html
<form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
```

You'll see other examples of modifiers later, [for `v-on`](./event-handling#event-modifiers) and [for `v-model`](./forms#modifiers), when we explore those features.

And finally, here's the full directive syntax visualized:

# Testing {#testing}

## Why Test? {#why-test}

Automated tests help you and your team build complex Vue applications quickly and confidently by preventing regressions and encouraging you to break apart your application into testable functions, modules, classes, and components. As with any application, your new Vue app can break in many ways, and it's important that you can catch these issues and fix them before releasing.

In this guide, we'll cover basic terminology and provide our recommendations on which tools to choose for your Vue 3 application.

There is one Vue-specific section covering composables. See [Testing Composables](#testing-composables) below for more details.

## When to Test {#when-to-test}

Start testing early! We recommend you begin writing tests as soon as you can. The longer you wait to add tests to your application, the more dependencies your application will have, and the harder it will be to start.

## Testing Types {#testing-types}

When designing your Vue application's testing strategy, you should leverage the following testing types:

- **Unit**: Checks that inputs to a given function, class, or composable are producing the expected output or side effects.
- **Component**: Checks that your component mounts, renders, can be interacted with, and behaves as expected. These tests import more code than unit tests, are more complex, and require more time to execute.
- **End-to-end**: Checks features that span multiple pages and makes real network requests against your production-built Vue application. These tests often involve standing up a database or other backend.

Each testing type plays a role in your application's testing strategy, and each will protect you against different types of issues.

## Overview {#overview}

We will briefly discuss what each of these are, how they can be implemented for Vue applications, and provide some general recommendations.

## Unit Testing {#unit-testing}

Unit tests are written to verify that small, isolated units of code are working as expected. A unit test usually covers a single function, class, composable, or module. Unit tests focus on logical correctness and only concern themselves with a small portion of the application's overall functionality. They may mock large parts of your application's environment (e.g. initial state, complex classes, 3rd party modules, and network requests).

In general, unit tests will catch issues with a function's business logic and logical correctness.

Take for example this `increment` function:

```js [helpers.js]
export function increment(current, max = 10) {
  if (current < max) {
    return current + 1
  }
  return current
}
```

Because it's very self-contained, it'll be easy to invoke the increment function and assert that it returns what it's supposed to, so we'll write a Unit Test.

If any of these assertions fail, it's clear that the issue is contained within the `increment` function.

```js{3-15} [helpers.spec.js]
import { increment } from './helpers'

describe('increment', () => {
  test('increments the current number by 1', () => {
    expect(increment(0, 10)).toBe(1)
  })

  test('does not increment the current number over the max', () => {
    expect(increment(10, 10)).toBe(10)
  })

  test('has a default max of 10', () => {
    expect(increment(10)).toBe(10)
  })
})
```

As mentioned previously, unit testing is typically applied to self-contained business logic, components, classes, modules, or functions that do not involve UI rendering, network requests, or other environmental concerns.

These are typically plain JavaScript / TypeScript modules unrelated to Vue. In general, writing unit tests for business logic in Vue applications does not differ significantly from applications using other frameworks.

There are two instances where you DO unit test Vue-specific features:

1. Composables
2. Components
