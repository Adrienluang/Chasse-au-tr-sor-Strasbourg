### Passing into function as argument {#passing-into-function-as-argument}

Given a function that expects a ref as an argument, e.g.:

```ts
function trackChange(x: Ref<number>) {
  watch(x, (x) => {
    console.log('x changed!')
  })
}

let count = $ref(0)
trackChange(count) // doesn't work!
```

The above case will not work as expected because it compiles to:

```ts
let count = ref(0)
trackChange(count.value)
```

Here `count.value` is passed as a number, whereas `trackChange` expects an actual ref. This can be fixed by wrapping `count` with `$$()` before passing it:

```diff
let count = $ref(0)
- trackChange(count)
+ trackChange($$(count))
```

The above compiles to:

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'

let count = ref(0)
trackChange(count)
```

As we can see, `$$()` is a macro that serves as an **escape hint**: reactive variables inside `$$()` will not get `.value` appended.
