### app.config.compilerOptions.comments {#app-config-compileroptions-comments}

Adjusts treatment of HTML comments in templates.

- **Type:** `boolean`

- **Default:** `false`

- **Details**

  By default, Vue will remove the comments in production. Setting this option to `true` will force Vue to preserve comments even in production. Comments are always preserved during development. This option is typically used when Vue is used with other libraries that rely on HTML comments.

- **Example**

  ```js
  app.config.compilerOptions.comments = true
  ```

## app.config.globalProperties {#app-config-globalproperties}

An object that can be used to register global properties that can be accessed on any component instance inside the application.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  interface AppConfig {
    globalProperties: Record<string, any>
  }
  ```

- **Details**

  This is a replacement of Vue 2's `Vue.prototype` which is no longer present in Vue 3. As with anything global, this should be used sparingly.

  If a global property conflicts with a component’s own property, the component's own property will have higher priority.

- **Usage**

  ```js
  app.config.globalProperties.msg = 'hello'
  ```

  This makes `msg` available inside any component template in the application, and also on `this` of any component instance:

  ```js
  export default {
    mounted() {
      console.log(this.msg) // 'hello'
    }
  }
  ```

## app.config.optionMergeStrategies {#app-config-optionmergestrategies}

An object for defining merging strategies for custom component options.

- **Type**

  ```ts
  interface AppConfig {
    optionMergeStrategies: Record<string, OptionMergeFunction>
  }

  type OptionMergeFunction = (to: unknown, from: unknown) => any
  ```

- **Details**

  Some plugins / libraries add support for custom component options (by injecting global mixins). These options may require special merging logic when the same option needs to be "merged" from multiple sources (e.g. mixins or component inheritance).

  A merge strategy function can be registered for a custom option by assigning it on the `app.config.optionMergeStrategies` object using the option's name as the key.

  The merge strategy function receives the value of that option defined on the parent and child instances as the first and second arguments, respectively.

- **Example**

  ```js
  const app = createApp({
    // option from self
    msg: 'Vue',
    // option from a mixin
    mixins: [
      {
        msg: 'Hello '
      }
    ],
    mounted() {
      // merged options exposed on this.$options
      console.log(this.$options.msg)
    }
  })

  // define a custom merge strategy for `msg`
  app.config.optionMergeStrategies.msg = (parent, child) => {
    return (parent || '') + (child || '')
  }

  app.mount('#app')
  // logs 'Hello Vue'
  ```

- **See also** [Component Instance - `$options`](/api/component-instance#options)

## app.config.idPrefix <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> {#app-config-idprefix}

Configure a prefix for all IDs generated via [useId()](/api/composition-api-helpers.html#useid) inside this application.

- **Type:** `string`

- **Default:** `undefined`

- **Example**

  ```js
  app.config.idPrefix = 'myApp'
  ```

  ```js
  // in a component:
  const id1 = useId() // 'myApp:0'
  const id2 = useId() // 'myApp:1'
  ```

## app.config.throwUnhandledErrorInProduction <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> {#app-config-throwunhandlederrorinproduction}

Force unhandled errors to be thrown in production mode.

- **Type:** `boolean`

- **Default:** `false`

- **Details**

  By default, errors thrown inside a Vue application but not explicitly handled have different behavior between development and production modes:

  - In development, the error is thrown and can possibly crash the application. This is to make the error more prominent so that it can be noticed and fixed during development.

  - In production, the error will only be logged to the console to minimize the impact to end users. However, this may prevent errors that only happen in production from being caught by error monitoring services.

  By setting `app.config.throwUnhandledErrorInProduction` to `true`, unhandled errors will be thrown even in production mode.

# Async Components {#async-components}

## Basic Usage {#basic-usage}

In large applications, we may need to divide the app into smaller chunks and only load a component from the server when it's needed. To make that possible, Vue has a [`defineAsyncComponent`](/api/general#defineasynccomponent) function:

```js
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // ...load component from server
    resolve(/* loaded component */)
  })
})
// ... use `AsyncComp` like a normal component
```

As you can see, `defineAsyncComponent` accepts a loader function that returns a Promise. The Promise's `resolve` callback should be called when you have retrieved your component definition from the server. You can also call `reject(reason)` to indicate the load has failed.

[ES module dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) also returns a Promise, so most of the time we will use it in combination with `defineAsyncComponent`. Bundlers like Vite and webpack also support the syntax (and will use it as bundle split points), so we can use it to import Vue SFCs:

```js
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent(() =>
  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')
)
```

The resulting `AsyncComp` is a wrapper component that only calls the loader function when it is actually rendered on the page. In addition, it will pass along any props and slots to the inner component, so you can use the async wrapper to seamlessly replace the original component while achieving lazy loading.

As with normal components, async components can be [registered globally](/guide/components/registration#global-registration) using `app.component()`:

```js
app.component('MyComponent', defineAsyncComponent(() =>
  import('./components/MyComponent.vue')
))
```

<div class="options-api">

You can also use `defineAsyncComponent` when [registering a component locally](/guide/components/registration#local-registration):

```vue
<script>
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

export default {
  components: {
    AdminPage: defineAsyncComponent(() =>
      import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')
    )
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <AdminPage />
</template>
```

</div>

<div class="composition-api">

They can also be defined directly inside their parent component:

```vue
<script setup>
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

const AdminPage = defineAsyncComponent(() =>
  import('./components/AdminPageComponent.vue')
)
</script>

<template>
  <AdminPage />
</template>
```

</div>

## Loading and Error States {#loading-and-error-states}

Asynchronous operations inevitably involve loading and error states - `defineAsyncComponent()` supports handling these states via advanced options:

```js
const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent({
  // the loader function
  loader: () => import('./Foo.vue'),

  // A component to use while the async component is loading
  loadingComponent: LoadingComponent,
  // Delay before showing the loading component. Default: 200ms.
  delay: 200,

  // A component to use if the load fails
  errorComponent: ErrorComponent,
  // The error component will be displayed if a timeout is
  // provided and exceeded. Default: Infinity.
  timeout: 3000
})
```

If a loading component is provided, it will be displayed first while the inner component is being loaded. There is a default 200ms delay before the loading component is shown - this is because on fast networks, an instant loading state may get replaced too fast and end up looking like a flicker.

If an error component is provided, it will be displayed when the Promise returned by the loader function is rejected. You can also specify a timeout to show the error component when the request is taking too long.

## Lazy Hydration <sup class="vt-badge" data-text="3.5+" /> {#lazy-hydration}

> This section only applies if you are using [Server-Side Rendering](/guide/scaling-up/ssr).

In Vue 3.5+, async components can control when they are hydrated by providing a hydration strategy.

- Vue provides a number of built-in hydration strategies. These built-in strategies need to be individually imported so they can be tree-shaken if not used.

- The design is intentionally low-level for flexibility. Compiler syntax sugar can potentially be built on top of this in the future either in core or in higher level solutions (e.g. Nuxt).
