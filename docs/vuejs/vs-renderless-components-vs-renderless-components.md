### vs. Renderless Components {#vs-renderless-components}

In the component slots chapter, we discussed the [Renderless Component](/guide/components/slots#renderless-components) pattern based on scoped slots. We even implemented the same mouse tracking demo using renderless components.

The main advantage of composables over renderless components is that composables do not incur the extra component instance overhead. When used across an entire application, the amount of extra component instances created by the renderless component pattern can become a noticeable performance overhead.

The recommendation is to use composables when reusing pure logic, and use components when reusing both logic and visual layout.
