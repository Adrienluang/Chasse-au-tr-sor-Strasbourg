### Help Triage Issues {#help-triage-issues}

Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.

We receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.

You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.
