### v0.1.0&#x20;

As mentioned previously, the API is low-level, it means that you have to handle the default values yourself: you can check the default values in the [defaults.ts](https://github.com/vite-pwa/assets-generator/tree/main/src/api/defaults.ts) module.

The CLI has been rebuilt on top of the API, you can check the [CLI documentation](/assets-generator/cli) for more details about the default values.

**NOTE**: when running StackBlitz playground, you will need to stop the dev server once started and then run `npm run build && npm run preview` to see the PWA in action.

# Astro

::: warning
You will need to update your application to use Vite ^3.1.0 and latest `vite-plugin-pwa` 0.13.1+.
:::

## Astro Integration

`vite-plugin-pwa` provides the new `@vite-pwa/astro` integration that will allow you to use `vite-plugin-pwa` in your Astro applications.

You will need to install `@vite-pwa/astro` using:

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @vite-pwa/astro
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add -D @vite-pwa/astro
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -D @vite-pwa/astro
```

:::

To update your project to use the new `vite-plugin-pwa` integration for Astro, you only need to change the Astro config file removing the PWA plugin if present:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import AstroPWA from '@vite-pwa/astro'

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    AstroPWA({
      /* your pwa options */
    })
  ]
})
```

## Importing Virtual Modules

::: warning
Since Astro will not inject any script in your application when using Astro components, you will need to use/import a PWA virtual module.
:::

You can also enable [Development Support](/guide/development) to test your PWA webmanifest and debug your custom service worker logic as you develop your Astro application.
