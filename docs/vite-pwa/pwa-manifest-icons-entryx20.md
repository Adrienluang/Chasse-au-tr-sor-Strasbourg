### PWA Manifest Icons Entry&#x20;

By default, the CLI will show the PWA manifest icons' entry in the terminal. You can disable it using `-m=false` or `--manifest=false` option from CLI or using `manifestIconsEntry: false` in the file configuration.

If you have configured `logLevel: 'silent'` in your configuration file, the CLI will not log the PWA manifest icons' entry.
