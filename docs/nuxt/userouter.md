# useRouter

```vue [app/pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const router = useRouter()
</script>
```

If you only need the router instance within your template, use `$router`:

```vue [app/pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <button @click="$router.back()">
    Back
  </button>
</template>
```

If you have a `app/pages/` directory, `useRouter` is identical in behavior to the one provided by `vue-router`.

## Basic Manipulation

- [`addRoute()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#addRoute-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Add a new route to the router instance. `parentName` can be provided to add new route as the child of an existing route.
- [`removeRoute()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#removeRoute-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Remove an existing route by its name.
- [`getRoutes()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#getRoutes-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Get a full list of all the route records.
- [`hasRoute()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#hasRoute-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Checks if a route with a given name exists.
- [`resolve()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#resolve-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Returns the normalized version of a route location. Also includes an `href` property that includes any existing base.

```ts [Example]
const router = useRouter()

router.addRoute({ name: 'home', path: '/home', component: Home })
router.removeRoute('home')
router.getRoutes()
router.hasRoute('home')
router.resolve({ name: 'home' })
```

::note
`router.addRoute()` adds route details into an array of routes and it is useful while building [Nuxt plugins](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/plugins) while `router.push()` on the other hand, triggers a new navigation immediately and it is useful in pages, Vue components and composable.

## Based on History API

- [`back()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#back-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Go back in history if possible, same as `router.go(-1)`.
- [`forward()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#forward-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Go forward in history if possible, same as `router.go(1)`.
- [`go()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#go-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Move forward or backward through the history without the hierarchical restrictions enforced in `router.back()` and `router.forward()`.
- [`push()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#push-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Programmatically navigate to a new URL by pushing an entry in the history stack. &#x2A;*It is recommended to use [`navigateTo`](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/api/utils/navigate-to) instead.**
- [`replace()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#replace-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Programmatically navigate to a new URL by replacing the current entry in the routes history stack. &#x2A;*It is recommended to use [`navigateTo`](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/api/utils/navigate-to) instead.**

```ts [Example]
const router = useRouter()

router.back()
router.forward()
router.go(3)
router.push({ path: '/home' })
router.replace({ hash: '#bio' })
```

## Navigation Guards

`useRouter` composable provides `afterEach`, `beforeEach` and `beforeResolve` helper methods that acts as navigation guards.

However, Nuxt has a concept of **route middleware** that simplifies the implementation of navigation guards and provides a better developer experience.

## Promise and Error Handling

- [`isReady()`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#isReady-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Returns a Promise that resolves when the router has completed the initial navigation.
- [`onError`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/interfaces/router#onError-){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Adds an error handler that is called every time a non caught error happens during navigation.

## Universal Router Instance

If you do not have a `app/pages/` folder, then [`useRouter`](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-router) will return a universal router instance with similar helper methods, but be aware that not all features may be supported or behave in exactly the same way as with `vue-router`.
