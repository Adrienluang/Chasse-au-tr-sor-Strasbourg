# Auto Imports

Example of the auto-imports feature in Nuxt with:

- Vue components in the `components/` directory are auto-imported and can be used directly in your templates.
- Vue composables in the `composables/` directory are auto-imported and can be used directly in your templates and JS/TS files.
- JS/TS variables and functions in the `utils/` directory are auto-imported and can be used directly in your templates and JS/TS files.
