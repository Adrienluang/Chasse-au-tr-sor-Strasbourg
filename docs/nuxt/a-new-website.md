# A New Website

Nuxt.com is the main entry point when you want to learn Nuxt. With **more than 300k visitors every month**, it was time to give it a new look and feel.

## New Design

We are back to the original colors of Nuxt, with a navy background (`#020420`) and its signature shiny green (`#00DC82`).

We wanted to achieve a consistent design across all our official documentations:

We really love this new design and hope you do too. &#x2A;*This is only the first step toward many improvements coming to the website.**

## Improved Navigation

From now on, you can easily jump between the five main documentation categories:

:video{.rounded.dark:border.dark:border-gray-700 controls poster="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1697548111/nuxt3/nuxt-website-docs-nav.jpg"}

On the right side, you can see the table of contents as well as community shortcuts: Edit this page, Chat on Discord, etc.

## Source Code Buttons

When looking at Nuxt built-in [components](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components), [composables](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables), [utils](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils), [commands](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands) and [kit utilities](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/kit), you can now jump to the source code by clicking on the :u-button[Source]{color="gray" icon="i-simple-icons-github" size="xs"} button.

Checkout an example on `<NuxtLink>` documentation page.

## Improved Search Feature

You may notice a new modal when hitting :kbd{value="meta"} :kbd{value="K"}. We leverage the Nuxt UI [`<CommandPalette>`](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/command-palette){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} components combined with Nuxt Content data (search & navigation) to provide a better search experience.

With the command palette, you can:

- Jump to a page
- Search in the documentation
- Search a module
- Switch the color mode

We plan to add more commands soon.

## Migration to Nuxt UI

The new website is powered by [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, our UI library tailored made for Nuxt and built on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} & [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}.

The website also uses [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, a set of premium components built on top of Nuxt UI to create beautiful & responsive Nuxt applications in minutes.

It includes components such as `<UHeader>`, `<UFooter>`, `<ULandingHero>`, `<ULandingCard>` and more.

::note
We plan to launch the full documentation of Nuxt UI Pro at the end of October. If you cannot wait and want early access, you can already [purchase a license](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/purchase){rel=""nofollow""} now and get access to our private repository on GitHub.
::

This [migration](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.com/pull/1365){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} was a great opportunity to improve Nuxt UI & UI Pro and fix some bugs, as well as a difference of [+9,004]{.text-primary} / [-23,113]{.text-error} lines of code changed.

## Open Graph Images

We are big fans of having a custom image when we share a link on social media. That's why we have added OG images on all our documentation pages.

Example of the [Installation page](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation):

![Nuxt OG Image](https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/image/docs/getting-started/introduction/og.png){.border.rounded.border-gray-700 height="630" width="1200"}

## What's next?

This new website is the beginning of upcoming changes we are planing, some of them are:

- Team & Contributors pages
- Integrations page to showcase all the possibilities with Nuxt: Hosting, CMS, Database, etc.
- Templates page (currently [nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}) to list official and community starters
- And more...

**We are looking forward to your feedback on [Twitter](https://x.com/nuxt_js){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nuxt){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} or [GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.com){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}**.
