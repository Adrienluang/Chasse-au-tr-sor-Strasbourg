# Why is it important to fix them?

Hydration mismatches are not just warnings - they are indicators of serious problems that can break your application:

## Performance Impact

- **Increased time to interactive**: Hydration errors force Vue to re-render the entire component tree, which will increase the time for your Nuxt app to become interactive
- **Poor user experience**: Users may see content flashing or unexpected layout shifts

## Functionality Issues

- **Broken interactivity**: Event listeners may not attach properly, leaving buttons and forms non-functional
- **State inconsistencies**: Application state can become out of sync between what the user sees and what the application thinks is rendered
- **SEO problems**: Search engines may index different content than what users actually see
