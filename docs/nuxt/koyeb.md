# Koyeb

Nuxt supports deploying on the [Koyeb serverless platform](https://www.koyeb.com/docs){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} with minimal configuration.

## Setup

1. Create a new Koyeb app for Nuxt following the [guide](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/deploy/nuxt){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}.
2. Set the `engines.node` field in your project's `package.json` file to a [Koyeb-supported version of Node.js](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/build-and-deploy/build-from-git/nodejs#runtime){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}:
   ```json \[package.json]
   {
     "engines": {
         "node": "20.x"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Ensure that `build` and `start` scripts are defined within the project's `package.json` file to define how to build and run the application:
   ```json \[package.json]
   {
     "scripts": {
         "build": "nuxt build",
         "start": "node .output/server/index.mjs"
     }
   }
   ```
4. During deployment, you'll need to configure environment variables. In your service settings, set the following [environment variable](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/build-and-deploy/environment-variables){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}:
   ```bash
   SERVER_PRESET=koyeb
   ```
5. Click "Deploy" to build and deploy your Nuxt app.
