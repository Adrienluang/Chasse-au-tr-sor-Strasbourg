# Licenses

The app bundles dependencies which contain the following licenses:

## dep-1 - 1.2.3 (CC0-1.0)

CC0 1.0 Universal

```

To serve the file at a different path, you can pass `{ fileName: 'license.md' }` for example, so that it's served at `https://example.com/license.md`. See the [`build.license`](/config/build-options.md#build-license) docs for more information.

## Build Optimizations

> Features listed below are automatically applied as part of the build process and there is no need for explicit configuration unless you want to disable them.

### CSS Code Splitting

Vite automatically extracts the CSS used by modules in an async chunk and generates a separate file for it. The CSS file is automatically loaded via a `<link>` tag when the associated async chunk is loaded, and the async chunk is guaranteed to only be evaluated after the CSS is loaded to avoid [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content#:~:text=A%20flash%20of%20unstyled%20content,before%20all%20information%20is%20retrieved.).

If you'd rather have all the CSS extracted into a single file, you can disable CSS code splitting by setting [`build.cssCodeSplit`](/config/build-options.md#build-csscodesplit) to `false`.

### Preload Directives Generation

Vite automatically generates `<link rel="modulepreload">` directives for entry chunks and their direct imports in the built HTML.

### Async Chunk Loading Optimization

In real world applications, Rollup often generates "common" chunks - code that is shared between two or more other chunks. Combined with dynamic imports, it is quite common to have the following scenario:

In the non-optimized scenarios, when async chunk `A` is imported, the browser will have to request and parse `A` before it can figure out that it also needs the common chunk `C`. This results in an extra network roundtrip:

```
Entry ---> A ---> C
```

Vite automatically rewrites code-split dynamic import calls with a preload step so that when `A` is requested, `C` is fetched **in parallel**:

```
Entry ---> (A + C)
```

It is possible for `C` to have further imports, which will result in even more roundtrips in the un-optimized scenario. Vite's optimization will trace all the direct imports to completely eliminate the roundtrips regardless of import depth.
