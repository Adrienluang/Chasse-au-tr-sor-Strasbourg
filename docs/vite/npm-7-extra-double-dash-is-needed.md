# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
$ npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue
```

```bash [Yarn]
$ yarn create vite my-vue-app --template vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm create vite my-vue-app --template vue

```bash [Bun]
$ bun create vite my-vue-app --template vue

```bash [Deno]
$ deno init --npm vite my-vue-app --template vue

See [create-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) for more details on each supported template: `vanilla`, `vanilla-ts`, `vue`, `vue-ts`, `react`, `react-ts`, `react-swc`, `react-swc-ts`, `preact`, `preact-ts`, `lit`, `lit-ts`, `svelte`, `svelte-ts`, `solid`, `solid-ts`, `qwik`, `qwik-ts`.

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

To create a project without interactive prompts, you can use the `--no-interactive` flag.

## Community Templates

create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out Awesome Vite for [community maintained templates](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#templates) that include other tools or target different frameworks.

For a template at `https://github.com/user/project`, you can try it out online using `https://github.stackblitz.com/user/project` (adding `.stackblitz` after `github` to the URL of the project).

You can also use a tool like [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project with one of the templates. Assuming the project is on GitHub and uses `main` as the default branch, you can create a local copy using:

```bash
npx degit user/project#main my-project
cd my-project

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Manual Installation

In your project, you can install the `vite` CLI using:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
$ npm install -D vite
```

```bash [Yarn]
$ yarn add -D vite
```

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm add -D vite
```

```bash [Bun]
$ bun add -D vite
```

```bash [Deno]
$ deno add -D npm:vite
```

:::

And create an `index.html` file like this:

```html
<p>Hello Vite!</p>
```

Then run the appropriate CLI command in your terminal:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
$ npx vite
```

```bash [Yarn]
$ yarn vite
```

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm vite
```

```bash [Bun]
$ bunx vite
```

```bash [Deno]
$ deno run -A npm:vite
```

:::

The `index.html` will be served on `http://localhost:5173`.

## `index.html` and Project Root

One thing you may have noticed is that in a Vite project, `index.html` is front-and-central instead of being tucked away inside `public`. This is intentional: during development Vite is a server, and `index.html` is the entry point to your application.

Vite treats `index.html` as source code and part of the module graph. It resolves `<script type="module" src="...">` that references your JavaScript source code. Even inline `<script type="module">` and CSS referenced via `<link href>` also enjoy Vite-specific features. In addition, URLs inside `index.html` are automatically rebased so there's no need for special `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholders.

Similar to static http servers, Vite has the concept of a "root directory" which your files are served from. You will see it referenced as `<root>` throughout the rest of the docs. Absolute URLs in your source code will be resolved using the project root as base, so you can write code as if you are working with a normal static file server (except way more powerful!). Vite is also capable of handling dependencies that resolve to out-of-root file system locations, which makes it usable even in a monorepo-based setup.

Vite also supports [multi-page apps](./build#multi-page-app) with multiple `.html` entry points.

#### Specifying Alternative Root

Running `vite` starts the dev server using the current working directory as root. You can specify an alternative root with `vite serve some/sub/dir`.
Note that Vite will also resolve [its config file (i.e. `vite.config.js`)](/config/#configuring-vite) inside the project root, so you'll need to move it if the root is changed.

## Command Line Interface

In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the `vite` binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with `npx vite`. Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

```json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
    "build": "vite build", // build for production
    "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
  }
}
```

You can specify additional CLI options like `--port` or `--open`. For a full list of CLI options, run `npx vite --help` in your project.

Learn more about the [Command Line Interface](./cli.md)

## Using Unreleased Commits

If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you can install a specific commit of Vite with https://pkg.pr.new:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
$ npm install -D https://pkg.pr.new/vite@SHA
```

```bash [Yarn]
$ yarn add -D https://pkg.pr.new/vite@SHA
```

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm add -D https://pkg.pr.new/vite@SHA
```

```bash [Bun]
$ bun add -D https://pkg.pr.new/vite@SHA
```

:::

Replace `SHA` with any of [Vite's commit SHAs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commits/main/). Note that only commits within the last month will work, as older commit releases are purged.

Alternatively, you can also clone the [vite repo](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to your local machine and then build and link it yourself ([pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitejs/vite.git
cd vite
pnpm install
cd packages/vite
pnpm run build
pnpm link --global # use your preferred package manager for this step
```

Then go to your Vite based project and run `pnpm link --global vite` (or the package manager that you used to link `vite` globally). Now restart the development server to ride on the bleeding edge!

To learn more about how and when Vite does releases, check out the [Releases](../releases.md) documentation.

::: tip Dependencies using Vite
To replace the Vite version used by dependencies transitively, you should use [npm overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) or [pnpm overrides](https://pnpm.io/9.x/package_json#pnpmoverrides).
