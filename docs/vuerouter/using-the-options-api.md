### Using the Options API

You can add the following options to route components:

* `beforeRouteEnter`
* `beforeRouteUpdate`
* `beforeRouteLeave`

```vue
<script>
export default {
  beforeRouteEnter(to, from) {
    // called before the route that renders this component is confirmed.
    // does NOT have access to `this` component instance,
    // because it has not been created yet when this guard is called!
  },
  beforeRouteUpdate(to, from) {
    // called when the route that renders this component has changed, but this component is reused in the new route.
    // For example, given a route with params `/users/:id`, when we navigate between `/users/1` and `/users/2`,
    // the same `UserDetails` component instance will be reused, and this hook will be called when that happens.
    // Because the component is mounted while this happens, the navigation guard has access to `this` component instance.
  },
  beforeRouteLeave(to, from) {
    // called when the route that renders this component is about to be navigated away from.
    // As with `beforeRouteUpdate`, it has access to `this` component instance.
  },
}
</script>
```

The `beforeRouteEnter` guard does **NOT** have access to `this`, because the guard is called before the navigation is confirmed, thus the new entering component has not even been created yet.

However, you can access the instance by passing a callback to `next`. The callback will be called when the navigation is confirmed, and the component instance will be passed to the callback as the argument:

```js
beforeRouteEnter (to, from, next) {
  next(vm => {
    // access to component public instance via `vm`
  })
}
```

Note that `beforeRouteEnter` is the only guard that supports passing a callback to `next`. For `beforeRouteUpdate` and `beforeRouteLeave`, `this` is already available, so passing a callback is unnecessary and therefore *not supported*:

```js
beforeRouteUpdate (to, from) {
  // just use `this`
  this.name = to.params.name
}
```

The **leave guard** is usually used to prevent the user from accidentally leaving the route with unsaved edits. The navigation can be canceled by returning `false`.

```js
beforeRouteLeave (to, from) {
  const answer = window.confirm('Do you really want to leave? you have unsaved changes!')
  if (!answer) return false
}
```
