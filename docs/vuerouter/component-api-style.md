### Component API style

Vue Router can be used with both the Composition API and the Options API. Where relevant, the examples in this guide will show components written in both styles. Composition API examples will typically use `<script setup>`, rather than an explicit `setup` function.

If you need a refresher about the two styles, see [Vue - API Styles](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles).
