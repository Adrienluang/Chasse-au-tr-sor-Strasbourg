### Next steps

If you'd like to see a complete example using Vite, you can use the [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) scaffolding tool, which has the option to include Vue Router in its example project:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create vue@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create vue
```

:::

The example project created by create-vue uses similar features to the ones we've seen here. You may find that a useful starting point for exploring the features introduced in the next few pages of this guide.
